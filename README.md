# Markov_Chain_Text_Generators
Text generators that are based on markov chain i have also written c# code to get data from the websites

These Are the Markov_Chain_Text Generators I implemented using dictionaries. I wrote the c# program that pulled the data for 3000 thousand poems in turkish about loneliness and 
longing for something . For the english one i used a pre made data set but the main python program is almost identical in both versions
