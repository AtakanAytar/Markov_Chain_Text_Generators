"Dear Writers I’m compiling the first in what I hope is a series of publications I’m calling artists among artists The theme for issue  is “Faggot Dinosaur” I hope to hear from you Thank you and best wishes"
Hailey Leithauser"Philosophic
in its complex ovoid emptiness
a skillful pundit coined it as a sort
of stopgap doorstop for those
quaint equations

Romans never
dreamt of In form completely clever
and discrete—a mirror come unsilvered
loose watch face without the works
a hollowed globe

from tip to toe
unbroken it evades the grappling
hooks of mass tilts the thin rim of no thing
remains embryonic sum
non-cogito"
Jody Gladding--FEAR"Wed like to talk with you about fear they said so
many people live in fear these days they drove up
all four of them in a small car nice  boy they said
beautiful dogs they said so friendly the man ahead
of the woman the other two waiting in the drive I
was outside digging up the garden no one home I said
what  are you selling  anyway Im  not interested I
said well you have a nice day they said heres our
card theres  a phone number you can call anytime
any other  houses down this road anyone else  live
here wed like to talk to them about living in fear"
Joseph Brodsky January "The Wise Men will unlearn your name
Above your head no star will flame
One weary sound will be the same—
the hoarse roar of the gale
The shadows fall from your tired eyes
as your lone bedside candle dies
for here the calendar breeds nights
till stores of candles fail

What prompts this melancholy key
A long familiar melody
It sounds again So let it be
Let it sound from this night
Let it sound in my hour of death—
as gratefulness of eyes and lips
for that which sometimes makes us lift
our gaze to the far sky

You glare in silence at the wall
Your stocking gapes no gifts at all
Its clear that you are now too old
to trust in good Saint Nick
that its too late for miracles
—But suddenly lifting your eyes
to heavens light you realize
your life is a sheer gift"

Naomi Shihab Nye Goats"In icy fields

Is water flowing in the tank

Will they huddle together warm bodies pressing

Is it the year of the goat or the sheep

Scholars debating Chinese zodiac

follower or leader

O lead them to a warm corner

little ones toward bulkier bodies

Lead them to the brush which cuts the icy wind

Another frigid night swooping down —

Aren’t you worried about them I ask my friend

who lives by herself on the ranch of goats

far from here near the town of Ozona

She shrugs “Not really

they know what to do They’re goats”"

Charles Bukowskia  dollar horse and a hundred dollar whore"don’t ever get the idea I am a poet you can see me
at the racetrack any day half drunk
betting quarters sidewheelers and straight thoroughs
but let me tell you there are some women there
who go where the money goes and sometimes when you
look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke
dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
it’s all hung together you look and you look and
you look and you can’t believe it there are ordinary women
and then there is something else that wants to make you
tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
across the back of the john anyhow the season
was dragging and the big boys were getting busted
all the non-pros the producers the cameraman
the pushers of Mary the fur salesman the owners
themselves and Saint Louie was running this day
a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close
he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
and  to  and I put a ten down on him
the driver broke him wide
took him out by the fence where he’d be alone
even if he had to travel four times as far
and that’s the way he went it
all the way by the outer fence
traveling two miles in one
and he won like he was mad as hell
and he wasn’t even tired
and the biggest blonde of all
all ass and breast hardly anything else
went to the payoff window with me

that night I couldn’t destroy her
although the springs shot sparks
and they pounded on the walls
later she sat there in her slip
drinking Old Grandad
and she said
what’s a guy like you doing
living in a dump like this
and I said
I’m a poet

and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed

you you    a poet

I guess you’re right I said I guess you’re right

but still she looked good to me she still looked good
and all thanks to an ugly horse

Gerard Manley HopkinsMy own heart let me more have pity on"My own heart let me more have pity on let
Me live to my sad self hereafter kind
Charitable not live this tormented mind
With this tormented mind tormenting yet
I cast for comfort I can no more get
By groping round my comfortless than blind
Eyes in their dark can day or thirst can find
Thirsts all-in-all in all a world of wet

Soul self come poor Jackself I do advise
You jaded let be call off thoughts awhile
Elsewhere leave comfort root-room let joy size
At God knows when to God knows what whose smile
s not wrung see you unforeseen times rather — as skies
Betweenpie mountains — lights a lovely mile"
Jill Alexander Essbaum am"The shift of sleepwalks and suicides
The occasion of owls and a demi-lune fog
Even God has nodded off

And wont be taking prayers til ten
Ad interim you put them on
As if your wants could keep you warm

As if You say your shibboleths
You thumb your beads You scry the glass
Night creeps to its precipice

And the broken rim of reason breaks
Again An obsidian sky betrays you
Every serrate shadow flays you

Soon enough the crow will caw
The cock will crow The door will close
He isnt coming back you know

And so wee wet hours of grief relent
In thirty years you might forget
Precisely how tonights pain felt

And in whose black house you dwelt"
Roberto Harrison"""i fail in the retry of possible gaps
for the middle of canyons
in crumbling lights
for the scarification of vinyl
it rides through the forest
and throbs a small packet
where parallel seams
scratch a readable surface
on the backs of the camels
in mirages of separate planes
to the bursting eclipse
of pronounceable service
two spots on its forehead call out
for the country of doubling masses
on a highway that cuts into faces
in line for the city
every stream ties a knot
for an opening under the sea

i lose all my digits
to the moon that will one day be bare
to the parched piles of breathing in farms
to the doorways that promise a morning
on the accident prone to a murder of chance
every mouse in the dust in the kitchen
will harvest the cold
in the sickness of scattering twigs
in the answer of mirrors
for the double that sings with the night
by the prayer full of ashes
under frozen cadavers that once
were the hearts
in the egg of a wound

i disappear in the wrap-up
for invisible letters that leave all the snow
for the hunt to deliver migration
on the mushroom fields full of returns
under beaches in roads by a promise
where the water turns into a home
and the blame of the air will no longer wail
for the spot in the cloud full of planets
while a bubble reenters a womb
for explosions in placards
like the front of a bus
crossing vines in a prairie
that were traced on the skin of a goat

i look at the picture of too many races
for the blood of a horse
that a bundle of sleeping
 shorted connections
for the change of electrical chairs
under pools of announcements
for the battling showers
that tell all the stories of war
to infants in sight of the corner of trading
for the telephones buried in answers
under barrooms and sawdust and piers
where the songs of an isthmus
circle the beacon
where the moon cannot pull
where a whisper
moves sand off a stone

i weigh every mote in my eye with the fingers of handshakes
they calibrate walks like the wheels of a car
they reflect in a wave
like untying the knot of a bruise full of ice
where once was a number
where the count was eleven
where equality lifts
like the dough
that incarcerates mud clots and showers
for the vanishing thorn
in a guide by the pillow
softly omitted
what the second hand sees
under gears by the hand of a cripple
for the ditch in a face that is fine

i bury my head in the leaves
that the buses were lost in
that day when i looked for her here in the Arctic
when the telephone poles were the marks of equators
when the mornings at home
could not write their own name
when the shepherd was singing too many shields
at the entrance of staring at stars in the basement
with the light in the chest of what follows
with a walking that pulls at two seals
for the trouble in words
in the empty
in the on and off one
why there have to be zeros
to raise all the shores
for piñatas to line themselves up in the snow
under spreading the phase
of recalling the crosshairs
on the hive
that the singing will never return
when the breaking gives others
a prompt to give air

i radio frequencies meant to undress all the parrots
in the knot that a hill on the head
of the viewer can see
without even a monkey to grow
with a molecule’s power
in a black hole instead of a screen
in identity swimming to surface
every outlook reframes on a break
in circular lots
by the parking spot full of directions
where a jacket sinks into the roll
of an orange in Fez
around trains in the mountains
that the pantomime echoes
in the valley of shells that call out
for an engine to answer
when penalties cease in the skull
of another score gone on the pavement
with the sound of a bell that is broken
to bear its first weight in the sand"

Ted Berrigan"th Birthday Evening at Harris’s""Nine stories high Second Avenue
On the roof there’s a party
All the friends are there watching
By the light of the moon the blazing sun
Go down over the side of the planet
To light up the underside of Earth
There are long bent telescopes for the friends
To watch this through The friends are all in shadow
I can see them from my bed inside my head
 years I’ve loved these dreams today
 years since I wrote for the first time a poem
On my birthday why did I wait so long
my land a good land
its highways go to many good places where
many good people were found a home land whose song comes up
from the throat of a hummingbird amp it ends
where the sun goes to across the skies of blue
I live there with you"
Suzanne Gardinier"Wasnt that your cheek against mine last night
Gin Streetlight When somebody loves you Impossible

When you reach the broken paddock fence
the sign will say Impossible

The color God painted my eyes A cross
between storm and ewerstream Impossible

All your wrong lovers without certificates
Stamped across their foreheads Impossible

Dear Torch Received your kind invitation
Regret conflagration impossible

You must mean a phantom Your hand at her waist
Your ache at her absence Not mine Impossible

A holy place in the emperors city
A peach in a stone Impossible

You the mask of a ram I the mask of a bull
Horn chips Mischling Torn doors Impossible

Dance without footprints Dance with no name
in a room with no lovers not touching Impossible

Your eyes One protecting your sleeping sons dreaming
One torchlit and trying to close Impossible

Dear Lion Heres a gazelle Hold her
in your teeth but no biting Yours Impossible"

William WaldenA Posy of Love Poems"TH CENTURY BC

How beautiful my wellbeloved is your body of granite—
It smites my eyes like an army with banners
Your lips are the red wine poured from goatskin bags
Your brows are warriors full-drawn bows
Your glances the arrows they shoot therefrom
And your hair is the mane of a lion tawny and thick

TH CENTURY

Let us not love tonight past mind
But stifle our intent
Lest blazing passion unconfined
Provoke imperilment

Against the dark our fierce desire
Would flare too bright for sight
So must we tame our blinding fire
And bank it for the night

With luminating dawns return
And appetites increase
Our lusty flame can safely burn
In furious release

TH CENTURY

Since even modest airs and prudish dress
May not deter rash beaux from wantonness
Can your unsullied innocence oervault
Concupiscent intention to assault
My sweet have no misgivings for you wear
So plainly insurmountable an air
That ogling lechers hunting amrous game
Will blush apologize and flee in shame

TH CENTURY

Ethereal nightingale gallantly singing
Your heart out in rich melodies
To insentient stones earless trees
And indifferent insects forsake them Go winging
To town like a dart to the mark I implore you
And serving as courier bird
Tell her who is waiting this word
""Im locked in my room and cant come but adore you"""
Yolanda Wisher" South rd Street Floor ""Sometimes we would get hungry for the neighborhood

ask his son to come put a new inner tube on my bike
Cross Ludlow past the mailbox on the corner
Risqué Video Dinos Pizza and the Emerald Laundromat
The fruit trucks tucked into th Street on the left
house eyes shut with boards fringes of children
Once we went into a store sunk into the street
owned by a Cambodian woman She sold everything
from evening gowns to soup Over to Walnut and th
where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita
draped in cucumber sauce The pregnant woman
behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic
We grab a juice from the freezer some chips
eye the bean and sweet potato pies

The sky is smeared squash tangerines in a glaze
Three girls and one boy jump doubledutch A white man
hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag
We look for money in the street steal flowers
from the church lawn The shit stain from the wino
is still on our step Mr Jim is washing a car for cash
John is cleaning his rims to Buju Banton
Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue-eyed woman
Linda on her way to the restaurant The sister

right outside our thick wood door But not today
Today is one of those days to come home from walking

black beans Smoke some Alice Coltrane Cut up

Langston Hughes-"I’m all alone in this world she said
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand—
The truth of the matter’s
I ain’t got no man

Big Boy opened his mouth and said
Trouble with you is
You ain’t got no head
If you had a head and used your mind
You could have me with you
All the time

He said Share your bed—
And your money too"
William Trowbridgeth Reunion Westide High"How did we get here so suddenly
with our bags and baggage looking
the worse for wear the ones misfortune

hasnt wrung into anything-but-perfect
strangers Old buddies old loves
old antagonists chat at the bar

in the Hilton lobby white-haired no-haired
dyed-haired ringers for those oldsters
so irrelevant to proms and cruising

to study halls and going steady—to life
as we knew it The smithereens
of yesteryear mostly orphans who’ve buried

Mom and Dad we’re holding out
in a Guadalcanal of hazard and heart-soreness
edema angina sarcoma thrombosis

Casualties mount as do the MIAs
Why arent we vexed Why arent we
screaming Never mind were here upright

and dont have time to skip the niceties
which never seemed so nice
or to sweat the threats as the dead

ever younger smile toward the future
from our senior yearbook Its too late
for a fallback plan Tonight

well savor the motel cuisine pass
the Inglenook and believe theres nothing
opulent as this departure"
Mónica de la Torre$"My economy is circular I earn money from an institution that owns most of
the businesses where I tend to spend most of my money

My economy is quasi-medieval trade-centered and guild-like

My economy is not canonical

My economy is a misfortune that recently befell me

My economy admits foundational narratives

My economy is language

My economy is the executioner’s reversal of fortune

My economy has no essential features

My economy admits parallax critiques of ideology

My economy owes something to over  dead soldiers

My economy does not intimate and would rather not split hairs about what
belongs to whom

My economy can’t stay out of things but can’t make it into the thick of
things either

My economy has questionable purchasing power

My economy has no surrogate

My economy has no interpretative skills but is rife with interpretative communi-
ties

My economy is of trees chopped down in Brooklyn and the gradual encir-
cling of brick

My economy is the new red

My economy thrives on shades of gray

My economy is an unremarkable tuna sandwich that is missing the slices of
tomato that I had asked for

My economy is a liter bottle of Poland Spring water coming not from
Poland but from Maine and bought at a university cafeteria in Uptown
Manhattan where there are quite a number of water foundations that deliver
water with a funky metallic aftertaste

My economy is a poem called “First Purchase of the Month” consisting of
two stanzas with six eight-word lines each within a larger poem that could
be endless but won’t be

Could’ve been an outfit for the Whitney Biennial

Couldn’t afford one nor did I need it

Who cares how you look at the zoo

it’s about the animals stupid Which reminds me

could’ve been the trail mix I snacked on

amp which I managed not to purchase myself



It was tuna on whole wheat lettuce jalapeños

a one liter bottle of water Poland Spring

Asked for tomato too which the lady forgot

You Puerto Rican she asked Don’t think so

said another one in Spanish Let me answer

No what made you think so The peppers


My economy needs contractions and abbreviations

My economy is not fixed

My economy is broken mispronounced

My economy has cold feet even if there are plenty of socks at home

My economy would like to be wholesome and sound

My economy is a gift certificate that is not enough for what I’d like to have
so I end up spending money at a store that I dislike in the first place and
will never visit again

My economy is a business lunch where I end up paying the bill instead of
the person who’d like me to work with her

My economy consists of performing tasks for which I receive no quantifi-
able pay

My economy grows when it’s enough to buy someone else a drink or a
meal

My economy does not allow me to say no

My economy pretends to be booming but instead is shaky and imploding

It doesn’t matter because my economy is predicated on virtue and it posits
that it’s purer than yours

My economy has no exchange value

I’d like to think of my economy as one of resistance and tactical difference

My economy is not a disposable good

There are no surpluses in my economy

I already owe what I just wrote

My economy is derivative parasitical and residual

My economy is a hand-me-down

My economy is not environmentally friendly although it’s not ravaging
non-renewable resources either

My economy doesn’t force me to put my money where my mouth is Were I
to pay for what I say it would be a different story

Thirteen cents a word is not fair trade

My economy mistakes what it means to trade in futures

In theory my economy is not the result of deliberate choice it is makeshift
and a tag-along

My economy has double standards

My economy has attention deficit disorder

My economy is the symptom of an incurable disease

My economy is not even mine

Suzanne Gardinier"Im used to the emperors bitterness
I cant find the sweet place unless you make me

This face that is not my face I may
look made but when you touch me you make me

Make the oak say blossom The stripped say swell
The avenue pavement say river Make me

This shirt I cant take off The one
the nights without you gathered to make me

The new day The sweet place Tomorrow
whispering from tonights last light Make me

Kissing you without authorization
If you want me to stop youll have to make me

interrupting your sleep to say Now To say Make me"

Jeff Daniel Marion RPM"In the back of the junkhouse
stacked on a cardtable covered
by a ragged bedspread they rest
black platters whose music once
crackled hissed with a static
like shuffling feet fox trot or two-step
the slow dance of the needle
riding its merry-go-round
my mother’s head nestled
on my father’s shoulder as they
turned lost in the sway of sounds
summer nights and faraway
places the syncopation of time
waltzing them to a world
they never dreamed dance
of then to the dust of now"

In black-and-white with a flow of light that
Would not die It all came back to me in different

Each other in adult life drifted across the

On horseback in dust and heat characters whose
Names emerged as if they mattered in a history

Toward neighbors different from themselves
Because that is what the picture is about with
Class distinctions moving the plot along A few
Could distinguish right from wrong those who

Could not you condemned from the beginning when
You noticed them at all Still others married or
Backed off from the ranch with poignant flair

Unearthed the treasures of oil buried his soul in
Money and went incoherent with alcohol When the s

Aged once more and said what they had to say along the
Way according to the script And then the end the
Hamburger joint brought into existence to the beat of
""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" Juana and her child the

Color of dark amber foreshadowing the Mexican-looking
Couple and their daughter all in muteness wanting
To be served I climbed out of bed and in my head
Was a roaring of light—words spoken and unspoken

Had brought the obliterated back Not again I said
From my second-floor roomlet this not be happening
Three and-a-half hours had flicked by As the sound
Trailed off into nothing memory would not dissolve"
Jill BialoskyThe Mothers"We loved them
We got up early
to toast their bagels
Wrapped them in foil
We filled their water bottles
and canteens We washed
and bleached their uniforms
the mud and dirt
and blood washed clean
of brutality We marveled
at their bodies
thighs thick as the trunk
of a spindle pine
shoulders broad and able
the way their arms filled out
The milk they drank
At the plate we could make out
their particular stance though each
wore the same uniform as if they were
cadets training for war
If by chance one looked up at us
and gave us a rise with his chin
or lifted a hand we beamed
We had grown used to their grunts
mumbles and refusal to form a full sentence
We made their beds and rifled through their pockets
and smelled their shirts to see if they were clean
How else would we know them
We tried to not ask too many questions
and not to overpraise
Sometimes they were ashamed of us
if we laughed too loud
if one of us talked too long to their friend
of our faces that had grown coarser
Can’t you put on lipstick
We let them roll their eyes
curse and grumble at us
after a game if they’d missed a play
or lost We knew to keep quiet
the car silent the entire ride home
What they were to us was inexplicable
Late at night after they were home in their beds
we sat by the window and wondered
when they would leave us
and who they would become
when they left the cocoon of our instruction
What kind of girl they liked
We sat in a group and drank our coffee
and prayed that they’d get a hit
If they fumbled a ball or struck out
we felt sour in the pit of our stomach
We paced We couldn’t sit still or talk
Throughout summer we watched
the trees behind the field grow fuller
and more vibrant and each fall
slowly lose their foliage—
it was as if we wanted to hold on
to every and each leaf"
Randall Jarrell North"At home in my flannel gown like a bear to its floe
I clambered to bed up the globes impossible sides
I sailed all night—till at last with my black beard
My furs and my dogs I stood at the northern pole

There in the childish night my companions lay frozen
The stiff furs knocked at my starveling throat
And I gave my great sigh the flakes came huddling
Were they really my end In the darkness I turned to my rest

—Here the flag snaps in the glare and silence
Of the unbroken ice I stand here
The dogs bark my beard is black and I stare
At the North Pole   
And now what Why go back

Turn as I please my step is to the south
The world—my world spins on this final point
Of cold and wretchedness all lines all winds
End in this whirlpool I at last discover

And it is meaningless In the childs bed
After the nights voyage in that warm world
Where people work and suffer for the end
That crowns the pain—in that Cloud-Cuckoo-Land

I reached my North and it had meaning
Here at the actual pole of my existence
Where all that I have done is meaningless
Where I die or live by accident alone—

Where living or dying I am still alone
Here where North the night the berg of death
Crowd me out of the ignorant darkness
I see at last that all the knowledge

I wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me—
Is worthless as ignorance nothing comes from nothing
The darkness from the darkness Pain comes from the darkness
And we call it wisdom It is pain"

—Billboard on Interstate 
Paris in the Spring Autumn in New York
Singers pair a city with a season
As though it belonged to it all year long
They should try to put a few more to work
Trenton in winter needs a good reason
Scranton in summer seems so very wrong
How about Cincinnati in the spring
Autumn in Passaic or in Oakland
Some cities just lack glamour and appeal
And there is no point arguing the thing
No one reads through stacks of brochures to spend
A honeymoon in Allentown Let’s get real
Most places on the map you must believe
No one wants to visit only to leave"
George HerbertAaron"Holiness on the head
Light and perfections on the breast
Harmonious bells below raising the dead
To lead them unto life and rest
Thus are true Aarons drest

Profaneness in my head
Defects and darkness in my breast
A noise of passions ringing me for dead
Unto a place where is no rest
Poor priest thus am I drest

Only another head
I have another heart and breast
Another music making live not dead
Without whom I could have no rest
In him I am well drest

Christ is my only head
My alone-only heart and breast
My only music striking me evn dead
That to the old man I may rest
And be in him new-drest

So holy in my head
Perfect and light in my dear breast
My doctrine tund by Christ who is not dead
But lives in me while I do rest
Come people Aarons drest"

A sandbox And Geometrical diagrams Or A frame divided in two sections and

Mary Rose OReilleyThe Abandoned Farm"In the northwest corner of Dakota I saw a room
someone had left a plush sofa returning its button-
eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder
the dog too turning In the next room the mattress
with mattress stories one after another tumbling
out of each spring the window she opened first thing
its vista of mile after mile and the windmill hauling
its load
I saw that and nothing alive—

green oil-figured linoleum laid on counters
nails of bad craft the ripped blackening edge
that scared her more than the bed and the sound
of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer
night after night the whack of her blade on the block
There are houses with too many knives
sometimes she said

but when June ferned its way in shed relent take on its
restraint heave again on the stained sheets her burden
of child herself a torn girl again combing her hair
through fingers bruised by corn shocks sweet juice
in the cuts of her life

She began to think of the border
and mustangs without brand At night theyd bend
over the bed and nuzzle One ride was enough
She had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare
over the windowsill I see where the curtain fell
and nobody mended the tear I see where bare feet
marked like fossils her pass in the rain

When he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring
why does he always think of that first sight
of her thigh in the peach-colored dress of his hands
searching moss with its red-gold stamens the spring
in that arid landscape like something from Canaan
under his tongue Even in old age hed ponder the moment
lying under the moon forgiving himself her the world
that bred their conundrum washed in that rain"
Ted KooserAbandoned Farmhouse"He was a big man says the size of his shoes
on a pile of broken dishes by the house
a tall man too says the length of the bed
in an upstairs room and a good God-fearing man
says the Bible with a broken back
on the floor below the window dusty with sun
but not a man for farming say the fields
cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn

A woman lived with him says the bedroom wall
papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves
covered with oilcloth and they had a child
says the sandbox made from a tractor tire
Money was scarce say the jars of plum preserves
and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole
And the winters cold say the rags in the window frames
It was lonely here says the narrow country road

Something went wrong says the empty house
in the weed-choked yard Stones in the fields
say he was not a farmer the still-sealed jars
in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste
And the child Its toys are strewn in the yard
like branches after a storm—a rubber cow
a rusty tractor with a broken plow
a doll in overalls Something went wrong they say"
Ron RashAbandoned Homestead in Watauga County"All that once was is this

Hayden Carruth"Abandoned Ranch Big Bend""Three people come where no people belong any more
They are a woman who would be young
And good-looking if these now seemed
Real qualities a child with yellow hair a man
Hardened in desperate humanity But here are only
Dry cistern adobe flaking a lizard And now this
Disagreeable feeling that they were summoned Sun
On the corrugated roof is a horse treading
A horse with wide wings and heavy hoofs The lizard
Is splayed head down on the wall pulsing They do not
Bother to lift their binoculars to the shimmering distance
From this dead center the desert spirals away
Traveling outward and inward pulsing Summoned
From half across the world from snow and rock
From chaos they arrived a moment ago they thought
In perfect fortuity There is a presence emerging here in
Sun dance and clicking metal where the lizard blinks
With eyes whetted for extinction then swirling
Outward again outward and upward through the skys
White-hot funnel Again and again among the dry
Wailing voices of displaced Yankee ghosts
This ranch is abandoned to terror and the sublime
The man turns to the woman and child He has never
Said what he meant They give him
The steady cool mercy of their unreproachful eyes"
Evan KennedyThe Abashed"Danger from others provoked
a change in my internal
law I was no flawed creature
but the unpersuaded
sure made their case
with their brutality
They tied me to a fence began
thrashing the life out of me
If the meek deserve
to jubilee in what bodies
are we to defend our selves
and supple registers
of bonum It’s time to confess
I was never cruising for
this bruising but maybe
just cruising
toward a rapid intercession
of effervescent affection
that could gift a beneficent
fever among us


Angels arrived to inhospitality
and I hear my body still groan in that aftermath


❖


I am my desire Grew up a screw-up
but bucked up a fuck-up
each thing I took into my nine holes
was rotting obviously What perils
when asleep when en route
in the sea in the wilderness
somehow I made it through
When beside myself I spotted
an antidote toward
a reversal in all places my biology
doomed me
True witness was clarified
by my thighs chest and throat To
quote that it’s flesh and it’s not—



Now from my
 Utah Street room
a couple of blocks away
a strangers’ elegy sinks toward
Earth To keep watch of community
beyond a shame that stills me—
We’ve been put outside
the populace to offset their enmity

❖


Singing on my way back to
Assisi a sissy I’m thrown into a ditch
It’s my bitch of a knee failing me
after so much cycling that groans
as though flesh has worthy feeling
These thieves think
I’m a rich troubadour despite
my nasal whine and valedictory hymn—
the one about poverty or maybe
I am that bad of a mumbler
Since I’m not much of
a stumbler it’s a whim to be made
inert through violence cops not long ago
would round up the likes of me
along Market Street so thanks men
for making this human a humble
and stilled thing alive only
unto your forces Earth will be
a swallower of your corpses

❖


Made of dirt would I know what
dirt tastes like While I was cycling
the earth and I
exceeded living bodies’ partitions
Wishing that the strewn parts of
you long gone ones
would reassemble in a gust
of florescence and soundtracks
I promise my legs can brace
for any supple clamor
If the dead all rise age thirty
at twenty-nine
still ahead is my finest glamour
Thus I became a hammer
to darkest anti-matter Thus
I became a ticking time bomb
of kingdom expectation in
my gray hoodie and sharp teeth


for Bruce Boone

❖


Bring forth any within you to save you
So made changeless a wave or nerve
to enact its fullness If I’m raised
over waste hold me there to vomit
the meat I’ve sucked down
and peril I’ve soaked in through
local commotion There is a continent
San Francisco
at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean

What is it to be equipping for
the convenience of
kingdom— such as swapping spit with
strangers giving dogs a good scratch
behind the ears
or fighting from my bicycle
the cars that could spell
my death in the papers And
drinking milkshakes in Mission diners
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and I threw up at the sight of that

My only security has been to garden civility
in city boots scuffled along the way
by impedimenta to my solace"
Dennis CooperABBA"for Brad Gooch
We snort all our coke
on the way to the party
We bring the new album
We dance while we listen

The band is two women
whose husbands control them
They do not speak our language
Each syllable’s an obstacle

They are in love with a man
He is in love with another
But they’re in no hurry
They could wait forever

And when they are out
on the make for a lover
they’ll always find him
They are the tigers

We are stoned too stoned to
We dance till we’re tired
and listen to lyrics
we mouth like a language

What we feel when we
hear them is inexpressible
We can’t put into words
Maybe our dances show it

ABBA lives for their music
We long for each other
They see what we’re doing
They put it on record

They play it we listen
We are absolutely stunned
We feel and they know
more than anyone can say"
Kathryn MarisABC"Identification is a highly important factor in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms by this means patients are enabled in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences but the experiences of a great number of other persons and can suffer as it were for a whole mass of people and fill all the parts of a drama by means of their own personalities alone
— Sigmund Freud
Anne identified with Cate until it became a bona fide
illness for Boris had left Cate resulting not only
in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream

of hostility directed not at Boris but at his new woman
Anne whom Cate viewed as her rival Cate remained
excessively tender with Boris though Cate for him

had been a “totem animal” from which he gained power
by “eating” Whereas Boris was the patriarch
Anne was the ego alien and whereas Cate was Anne’s

fixation Anne was no one’s obsession so she was
admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden
associations she could not be induced to abandon

On the rare occasions she slept the manifest and latent
content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment
between Boris and Cate which Anne in her waking hours

projected onto the walls as though screening a silent film
She could not be induced to abandon this footage
she could not be induced to abandon her object love

of Boris whose own object choice was his
ego-libido or her identification with Cate who felt
no friendship towards Anne Soon Anne drew a mental

triangle on every surface she saw be it phallic or
concave and sometimes this triangle was isosceles
sometimes it was equilateral and often it was right"

Mary Jo BangABC Plus E Cosmic Aloneness Is the Bride of  Existence"A pack of  young flirts was patrolling the party
They were cultural outsiders consumed with        what
Their own notion of  beauty as reflected in the shine-more mirror
Of  a mans pants Or nothing
But midnight and no one is counting

They were practitioners they admitted to the barman
Of  psychological materialism explaining they had read both
Sartre and Beauvoir and believed in the cerebellum
The thalamus and the lower brain and that between
The lower and the upper parts there must be room for them
Nant  nothingness  aside

Indeed the evening was a spectacular bacchanalia
The girls lugging their blind-drunk partners around the floor
One sitting it out with a volume of The Collected Camus
That one was “imperious” the word is Beauvoirs
“The club was plunged into almost total darkness
With violinists wandering about
‘Playing soulful Russian music into the guests ears”
“‘If only it were possible to tell the truth
Exclaimed Camus at one point”

There was vodka and champagne both in quantities
Extremely beautiful and nice for getting tight And dancing
Cheek to cheek between the exchange of  furtive kisses
And giggles every time one of  the chaps said “Dont
Leave me I love you Ill always love you”
Which they took as irrefutable evidence

That night into naughty boys echoing the girls questions
Of   “how shall we live” “what shall we do”
Words without end without weight"

What question could I answer with my lies

Digesting everything it’s all so plain
In him his abdomen so thin the pain

Is almost visible I probe the lump
His boyfriend noticed first my left hand limp

Beneath the pressure of the right With AIDS
You have to think lymphoma—swollen nodes

A tender spleen the liver’s jutting edge—
It strikes me suddenly I will oblige

This hunger that announces death is near
And as I touch him cold and cavalier

The language of beneath the diaphragm
Has told me where it’s coming from

And where I’m going too soft skin to rocks
The body reveling until it wrecks

Against the same internal hidden shoal
The treasures we can’t hide our swallowed gold"

Maybe in a Christmas pageant or something—
Nazarene church holds one every December
organized by Pastor John’s wife It’s no wonder
Pastor John’s son is the angel—everyone knows angels are white
Quit bothering with angels I say They’re no good for Indians
Remember what happened last time
some white god came floating across the ocean
Truth is there may be angels but if there are angels
up there living on clouds or sitting on thrones across the sea wearing
velvet robes and golden rings drinking whiskey from silver cups
we’re better off if they stay rich and fat and ugly and

And in our lineage of bypassed hearts

Amy FleuryAblution"Because one must be naked to get clean
my dad shrugs out of his pajama shirt
steps from his boxers and into the tub
as I brace him whose long illness
has made him shed modesty too
Seated on the plastic bench he holds
the soap like a caught fish in his lap
waiting for me to test the water’s heat
on my wrist before turning the nozzle
toward his pale skin He leans over
to be doused then hands me the soap
so I might scrub his shoulders and neck
suds sluicing from spine to buttock cleft
Like a child he wants a washcloth
to cover his eyes while I lather
a palmful of pearlescent shampoo
into his craniotomy-scarred scalp
and then rinse clear whatever soft hair
is left Our voices echo in the spray
and steam of this room where once
long ago he knelt at the tub’s edge
to pour cups of bathwater over my head
He reminds me to wash behind his ears
and when he judges himself to be clean
I turn off the tap He grips the safety bar
steadies himself and stands Turning to me
his body is dripping and frail and pink
And although I am nearly forty
he has this one last thing to teach me
I hold open the towel to receive him"
Louise GlückAboriginal Landscape"You’re stepping on your father my mother said
and indeed I was standing exactly in the center
of a bed of grass mown so neatly it could have been
my father’s grave although there was no stone saying so

You’re stepping on your father she repeated
louder this time which began to be strange to me
since she was dead herself even the doctor had admitted it

I moved slightly to the side to where
my father ended and my mother began

The cemetery was silent Wind blew through the trees
I could hear very faintly sounds of  weeping several rows away
and beyond that a dog wailing

At length these sounds abated It crossed my mind
I had no memory of   being driven here
to what now seemed a cemetery though it could have been
a cemetery in my mind only perhaps it was a park or if not a park
a garden or bower perfumed I now realized with the scent of roses —
douceur de vivre filling the air the sweetness of  living
as the saying goes At some point

it occurred to me I was alone
Where had the others gone
my cousins and sister Caitlin and Abigail

By now the light was fading Where was the car
waiting to take us home

I then began seeking for some alternative I felt
an impatience growing in me approaching I would say anxiety
Finally in the distance I made out a small train
stopped it seemed behind some foliage the conductor
lingering against a doorframe smoking a cigarette

Do not forget me I cried running now
over many plots many mothers and fathers —"
Leigh HuntAbou Ben Adhem"Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
And saw within the moonlight in his room
Making it rich and like a lily in bloom
An angel writing in a book of gold—
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold
And to the presence in the room he said
""What writest thou""—The vision raised its head
And with a look made of all sweet accord
Answered ""The names of those who love the Lord""
""And is mine one"" said Abou ""Nay not so""
Replied the angel Abou spoke more low
But cheerly still and said ""I pray thee then
Write me as one that loves his fellow men""

The angel wrote and vanished The next night
It came again with a great wakening light
And showed the names whom love of God had blest
And lo Ben Adhems name led all the rest"

him ‘you’re a jerk’ ‘whatcha mean’ he
asked ‘I mean you’re a jerk you’re  years old and
you don’t know anything’”

“what happened
then”
“I walked out”
“you mean you left him there with
her”
“yes”

“I can’t quit my job” he said “I always have trouble getting a
job I walk in they look at me listen to me talk and
they think right away ah ha he’s too intelligent for
this job he won’t stay
so there’s really no sense in hiring
him
now YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble
you look like an old wino you look like a guy who needs a
job and they look at you and they think
ah ha now here’s a guy who really needs work if we hire
him he’ll stay a long time and work
HARD”

“do any of those people” he asks “know you are a
writer that you write poetry”
“no”
“you never talk about
it not even to
me if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d
have never known”
“that’s right”
“still I’d like to tell these people that you are a
writer”
“I’d still like to
tell them”
“why”
“well they talk about you they think you are just a
horseplayer and a drunk”
“I am both of those”
“well they talk about you you have odd ways you travel alone
I’m the only friend you
have”
“yes”
“they talk you down I’d like to defend you I’d like to tell
them you write
poetry”
“leave it alone I work here like they
do we’re all the same”
“well I’d like to do it for myself then I want them to know why
I travel with
you I speak  languages I know my music—”
“forget it”
“all right I’ll respect your
wishes but there’s something else—”
“what”
“I’ve been thinking about getting a
piano but then I’ve been thinking about getting a
violin too but I can’t make up my
mind”
“buy a piano”
“you think
so”
“yes”

he walks away
thinking about
it

I was thinking about it
too I figure he can always come over with his
violin and more
sad music"
John CiardiAbout the Teeth of Sharks"The thing about a shark is—teeth
One row above one row beneath

Now take a close look Do you find
It has another row behind

Still closer—here I’ll hold your hat
Has it a third row behind that

Now look in andLook out Oh my
I’ll never know now Well goodbye"
Gary SnyderAbove Pate Valley"We finished clearing the last
Section of trail by noon
High on the ridge-side
Two thousand feet above the creek
Reached the pass went on
Beyond the white pine groves
Granite shoulders to a small
Green meadow watered by the snow
Edged with Aspen—sun
Straight high and blazing
But the air was cool
Ate a cold fried trout in the
Trembling shadows I spied
A glitter and found a flake
Black volcanic glass—obsidian—
By a flower Hands and knees
Pushing the Bear grass thousands
Of arrowhead leavings over a
Hundred yards Not one good
Head just razor flakes
On a hill snowed all but summer
A land of fat summer deer
They came to camp On their
Own trails I followed my own
Trail here Picked up the cold-drill
Pick singlejack and sack
Of dynamite
Ten thousand years"
James LaughlinAbove the City"You know our office on the th
floor of the Salmon Tower looks
right out on the

Empire State and it just happened
we were there finishing up some
late invoices on

a new book that Saturday morning
when a bomber roared through the

flames poured from the windows
into the drifting clouds and sirens
screamed down in

Will AlexanderAbove the Human Nerve Domain"To unlock predisposives in carbon
to cancel sleep as pyretical drachma
not as transaxial summa
or intense aboriginal invasive
but as promenade
as forgery by craft
as soiled apparitional anagram

yes
as a dark stochastic wheat drained of its magic as drift
being boundary
being hellish invention as grasp

I am thinking of aroused electrical blockage
of human monsoon killing as treaty
as breach
as strangled impulse by identity

I mean
the psychic root which is stained by dialectical illness
by the thought contained in black ozonal mirrors
where general slaughter is reflected
where the mind impels its wits by bleak molecular isolation
by stunted mangrove withdrawal
by absence from the life of euphoric solar trees

such prone negation
imploded from the realms of a suicide foundry
of broken wisdom as diamond
it is an eon of fallen snow in a well
an injudicious barrier gone awry
the ingrained Eurocentric example
of the hatred of the darker integument
with its combative belligerence against the core
of volational mystery

so what concerns me
is a yoga which implodes the sun
which compounds its runics
the body then electric
like a stunning sapphire serpent
with the arc of its cells
alive as interior alter species
as an eye of analogical waters

no longer of ennui
of the praxis of perfidious helium atrocity
extended by the vapour of betrayal
by the dazed imperceptives in the molecules

here
in such preternatural enclave
I swim in the murmur of sun dogs
of kindled potentate spasms
like interior distillation
from Moorish pre-Copernica

as if
at the height of Kemetic day
there existed the dauntless sphinxian geometries
those pre-existent personas of lightning
no longer of the form of gravity as bastion
of lingering ammonia in the genes

but of absent chemical flaw
the body becoming
the magic flight of a transmuted corium
of the bell of a bloodless liminal amber"
Karenne Wood"Abracadabra an Abecedarian""All this time Ive been looking for words for certain difficult women

because they arent able to speak for themselves and now the

Clinton Foundation has come up with a brilliant campaign—they

decided for International Womens Day through digital magic to

erase women on the cover of
Condé Nast posters billboards those
figures replaced by empty space because women have not yet achieved

gender equity as noted on a website not-thereorg and theyre right We

havent But when I read about not-thereorg and saw its flashy graphics

I wasnt thinking about how women are not-there-yet metaphorically I

just thought about women who are really not there women and girls who

keep disappearing not from magazines who dont make news in Manhattan

like theyve evaporated like illusions hundreds in Juárez twelve hundred

missing and murdered Native women across Canada The hands of men


Now you see her Not Not-there Not here either


or anywhere Maybe only part of the problem is the predatory perpetrator-

prestidigitator who more often than not knows her knows how to keep her

quiet who may claim to love her even maybe getting even—or the serial

rapist-killer in the bushes who bushwhacks her in the dark Youre always safe

says the forensic psychiatrist unless a monster happens to show up and

then youre not Not-there Maybe a lonely mandible maxilla fibula or

ulna shows up or a bagged body gets dragged from the river Or not Is this the

value we permit a womans life to have or not-have throughout a wrong

world a global idea of her as disposable parts In the end this is not a

xenophobic poem not specific—its everywhere Not-there Right here

zero between them like a chalked outline in their family photograph Or not"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""The abracadabra boys—have they been in the stacks and cloisters Have they picked up languages for throwing into chow mein poems
Have they been to a sea of jargons and brought back jargons Their salutations go Who cometh and It ith I cometh
They know postures from impostures pistils from pustules to hear them tell it They foregather and make pitty pat with each other in Latin and in their private pig Latin very ofay
They give with passwords “Who cometh” “A kumquat cometh” “And how cometh the kumquat” “On an abbadabba ancient and honorable sire ever and ever on an abbadabba”
Do they have fun Sure—their fun is being what they are like our fun is being what we are—only they are more sorry for us being what we are than we are for them being what they are
Pointing at you at us at the rabble they sigh and say these abracadabra boys “They lack jargons They fail to distinguish between pustules and pistils They knoweth not how the kumquat cometh”"
Abraham LincolnAbraham Lincoln"Abraham Lincoln
his hand and pen
he will be good but
god knows When"
Melvin B TolsonAbraham Lincoln of Rock Spring Farm"I

Along the Wilderness Road through Cumberland Gap
The black ox hours limped toward Sunday’s sun
Across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone
Where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush
From February’s fang and claw the stars
Blue white like sheer icicles spired aglow
As if the three wise men barged in the East
Or priests in sackcloth balked the Scourge of God

Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law
The scrubby log cabin dared the compass points
Of Rock Spring farm man’s world God’s universe
The babel of the circumstance and era
The frozen socket of its window stared
Beyond the spayed crabapple trees to where
The skulls of hills the skeletons of barrens
Lay quiet as time without the watch’s tick

Not knowing muck and star would vie for him
The man Tom sank upon ax-split stool
Hands fisted feet set wide to brace the spirit
Big shoulders shoved dark hazel eyes glazed by
Grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced
Up up the stick-clay chimney While fire imps combed
The black and bristling hair the acids of thoughts
Made of the orby face an etching-plate


II

Near pyrotechnic logs the purling kettle
Aunt Peggy puffed her pipe on God’s rich time
A granny at a childbed on the border
Where head and backbone answered the tomahawk
Her wise old eyes had seen a hundred Nancys
In travail tread the dark winepress alone
Her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed
Into the outer world of pitch and toss

The cabin that her myth and mission entered
Became a castle in which Aunt Peggy throned
A dynasty of grunts and nods and glances
The nest the barn the hovel had schooled her in
The ABC of motherhood and somehow
She’d lost her ego in the commonweal
She sensed so accurately a coming child
That rakes dubbed her the St Bernard of Sex

And now her keyhole look explored Tom Lincoln
Beneath the patched homespun the hue and cry
Of malice until she touched his loneliness
The taproot that his fiber gave no tongue
Then lulling the wife troubled in flesh and mind
She eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while
There’s but one way of coming into the world
And seven times seventy ways of leaving it


III

The woman Nancy like a voyager sucked
Into the sea’s whale belly by a wreck
Buoyed to the surface air of consciousness
And clutched the solace of her corn-husk bed
Her dark face sharped in forehead cheekbone chin
Cuddled in dark brown hair her eyes waxed grayer
With wonder of the interlude her beauty
And courage choked Aunt Peggy’s hyperbole

Out of the fog of pain the bog of bygones
The bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle
She picked the squares to piece tomorrow’s quilt
She puzzled now as then about her father
Who let wild Lucy Hanks bundle and carry
Flesh of his flesh beyond the Cumberland Gap
A strange roof is no roof when imps of fear
Pilfer the fatherless in blossom time

Year in year out the daughter tinkered with
The riddle of her birth the mother chided
The woman Nancy as she had the child
“Hush thee hush thee thy father’s a gentleman”
The butt of bawd grand jury Sunday bonnet
Lucy driven taught her daughter the Word
And Nancy driven taught her son the Word
And Abraham driven taught his people the Word


IV

The man Tom bit his fingernails then rammed
His pockets with the hector hands that gave
Raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin
And in his lame speech said “Aunt Peggy listen
Now that our Nancy’s time is come I’m haunted
By my own nothingness Why breed nobodies”
He tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot
That aided fist and skull in border fights

Aunt Peggy counseled “Tom you say the say
Poor Joseph probably said in that low stable
Ere Jesus came into this mishmash world”
She paused then boxed the ears of cynicism
“It’s true down in the barnyard blood speaks loud
Among the hogs the chickens the cows the horses
But when it comes to Man who knows who knows
What greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother”

The man Tom turned and spat his naked surmise
Ranged out and out Aunt Peggy’s innermost said
“Your father Abraham bred like Daniel Boone
Conquered a land with gun and ax and plow
Baptized it in his blood I say I’ve said
What’s in a baby is God Almighty’s business
How the elders wring it out is worry enough
The best the worst—it’s all all human nature”


V

The tavern Tom remembered the New Year’s Eve
The clubfoot scholar bagged in Old World clothes
With arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard
An Oxford don he hymned the Bastille’s fall
In spite of the hair-hung sword his betters set
Him free to hail new truths in new lands where
He seined with slave and master knave and priest
And out of all fished up the rights of man

“As Citizen Lincoln asks ‘What’s human nature’
His full mug says a clear mind puts the question
Which ties the fogey scholar in a knot
My new idea fed to his new baby
Would fetch the New World and the New Year peace
The sum of anything unriddles the riddle
The child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all
Grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind

“To make a New World and a New Year Plato
And Jesus begged the boon of little children
Now Citizen Lincoln asks ‘What’s human nature’
It’s what we elders have no baby has it
It’s what our good and bad graft on the neutral
It’s what our rulers feed the boy and girl
It’s what society garbs nature in
It’s a misnomer call it human nurture”


VI

Aunt Peggy hovered closer with flawless rites
Grown lyrical from habit muffled pain sounds
Dragged from the bed of cleated poles she hawed
Tom Lincoln as one turns a nag aside
Then swooped her way even as a setting hen
Carves a dictatorship from yard to nest
And Tom again was squeezed into a cell
Whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess

Later his memories climbed a gala peak
His Nancy’s infare that ran riotous
The bear meat venison wild turkey duck
The maple sugar hanging for the whiskey
The red ham gourds of syrup bowls of honey
The wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep
The guzzling fiddling guttling monkeyshining
A continent sprawled between that day and this

A havenot on the frontier is no havenot
A Crusoe without Friday has no conscience
Yet Tom’s grub living gnawed him like the teeth
Of slavery land titles melancholy
He like his forebears visioned a Promised Land
And tidied ways and means to fly the barrens
That doomed the flesh to peck to patch to pinch
And wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry


VII

The black ox hours limped by and day crawled after
White prongs of ice like dinosaur fangs gleamed in
The cavernous mouth of Rock Spring snowbirds shivered
And chirped rebellion a cow with jags and gaps
Chewed emptily hogs squealed in hunger fits
And scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney
Which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses
Of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert

Nancy lay white serene like virgin milk
After the udder’s fury in the pail
Beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe
In yellow petticoat and linsey shirt
The baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled—
An anonymity of soft red wrinkles
Aunt Peggy hovering grinned “He’s Sabbath-born
Remember …Sunday—it’s red-letter day”

Like ax and helve like scythe and snath the bond
Held Tom and Nancy she smiled at his halt smile
His titan’s muss in picking up the baby
Tom frowned and spat then gulped “He’s legs All legs”
Aunt Peggy beamed “Long legs can eat up miles”
Tom gloomed “The hands—look at the axman’s hands”
And Nancy mused “The Hankses’ dream the Lincolns’
Needs such a man to hew and blaze the way”"
Vachel LindsayAbraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight"In Springfield Illinois
It is portentous and a thing of state
That here at midnight in our little town
A mourning figure walks and will not rest
Near the old court-house pacing up and down

Or by his homestead or in shadowed yards
He lingers where his children used to play
Or through the market on the well-worn stones
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away

A bronzed lank man His suit of ancient black
A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl
Make him the quaint great figure that men love
The prairie-lawyer master of us all

He cannot sleep upon his hillside now
He is among us—as in times before
And we who toss and lie awake for long
Breathe deep and start to see him pass the door

His head is bowed He thinks on men and kings
Yea when the sick world cries how can he sleep
Too many peasants fight they know not why
Too many homesteads in black terror weep

The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart
He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main
He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now
The bitterness the folly and the pain

He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn
Shall come—the shining hope of Europe free
The league of sober folk the Workers Earth
Bringing long peace to Cornland Alp and Sea

It breaks his heart that kings must murder still
That all his hours of travail here for men
Seem yet in vainAnd who will bring white peace
That he may sleep upon his hill again"
John DrydenAbsalom and Achitophel"In pious times ere priest-craft did begin
Before polygamy was made a sin
When man on many multiplid his kind
Ere one to one was cursedly confind
When Nature prompted and no Law denid
Promiscuous use of concubine and bride
Then Israels monarch after Heavens own heart
His vigorous warmth did variously impart
To wives and slaves and wide as his command
Scatterd his Makers image through the land
Michal of royal blood the crown did wear
A soil ungrateful to the tillers care
Not so the rest for several mothers bore
To god-like David several sons before
But since like slaves his bed they did ascend
No true succession could their seed attend
Of all this numerous progeny was none
So beautiful so brave as Absalom
Whether inspird by some diviner lust
His father got him with a greater gust
Or that his conscious destiny made way
By manly beauty to imperial sway
Early in foreign fields he won renown
With kings and states allid to Israels crown
In peace the thoughts of war he could remove
And seemd as he were only born for love
Whateer he did was done with so much ease
In him alone twas natural to please
His motions all accompanid with grace
And Paradise was opend in his face
With secret joy indulgent David viewd
His youthful image in his son renewd
To all his wishes nothing he denid
And made the charming Annabel his bride
What faults he had for who from faults is free
His father could not or he would not see
Some warm excesses which the Law forbore
Were construd youth that purged by boiling oer
And Amnons murther by a specious name
Was calld a just revenge for injurd fame
Thus praisd and lovd the noble youth remaind
While David undisturbd in Sion reignd
But life can never be sincerely blest
Heavn punishes the bad and proves the best
The Jews a headstrong moody murmring race
As ever trid thextent and stretch of grace
Gods pamperd people whom debauchd with ease
No king could govern nor no God could please
Gods they had trid of every shape and size
That god-smiths could produce or priests devise
These Adam-wits too fortunately free
Began to dream they wanted liberty
And when no rule no precedent was found
Of men by laws less circumscribd and bound
They led their wild desires to woods and caves
And thought that all but savages were slaves
They who when Saul was dead without a blow
Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego
Who banisht David did from Hebron bring
And with a general shout proclaimd him king
Those very Jews who at their very best
Their Humour more than loyalty exprest
Now wonderd why so long they had obeyd
An idol-monarch which their hands had made
Thought they might ruin him they could create
Or melt him to that golden calf a state
But these were random bolts no formd design
Nor interest made the factious crowd to join
The sober part of Israel free from stain
Well knew the value of a peaceful reign
And looking backward with a wise afright
Saw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight
In contemplation of whose ugly scars
They curst the memory of civil wars
The moderate sort of men thus qualifid
Inclind the balance to the better side
And Davids mildness managd it so well
The bad found no occasion to rebel
But when to sin our biasd nature leans
The careful Devil is still at hand with means
And providently pimps for ill desires
The good old cause revivd a plot requires
Plots true or false are necessary things
To raise up common-wealths and ruin kings

Th inhabitants of old Jerusalem
Were Jebusites the town so calld from them
And theirs the native right—
But when the chosen people grew more strong
The rightful cause at length became the wrong
And every loss the men of Jebus bore
They still were thought Gods enemies the more
Thus worn and weakend well or ill content
Submit they must to Davids government
Impoverishd and deprivd of all command
Their taxes doubled as they lost their land
And what was harder yet to flesh and blood
Their gods disgracd and burnt like common wood
This set the heathen priesthood in a flame
For priests of all religions are the same
Of whatsoeer descent their godhead be
Stock stone or other homely pedigree
In his defence his servants are as bold
As if he had been born of beaten gold
The Jewish Rabbins though their Enemies
In this conclude them honest men and wise
For twas their duty all the learned think
Tespouse his cause by whom they eat and drink
From hence began that plot the nations curse
Bad in itself but represented worse
Raisd in extremes and in extremes decrid
With oaths affirmd with dying vows denid
Not weighd or winnowd by the multitude
But swallowd in the mass unchewd and crude
Some truth there was but dashd and brewd with lies
To please the fools and puzzle all the wise
Succeeding times did equal folly call
Believing nothing or believing all
Th Egyptian rites the Jebusites embracd
Where gods were recommended by their taste
Such savry deities must needs be good
As servd at once for worship and for food
By force they could not introduce these gods
For ten to one in former days was odds
So fraud was usd the sacrificers trade
Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade
Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews
And rakd for converts even the court and stews
Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took
Because the fleece accompanies the flock
Some thought they Gods anointed meant to slay
By guns invented since full many a day
Our author swears it not but who can know
How far the Devil and Jebusites may go
This plot which faild for want of common sense
Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence
For as when raging fevers boil the blood
The standing lake soon floats into a flood
And evry hostile humour which before
Slept quiet in its channels bubbles oer
So several factions from this first ferment
Work up to foam and threat the government
Some by their friends more by themselves thought wise
Opposd the powr to which they could not rise
Some had in courts been great and thrown from thence
Like fiends were hardend in impenitence
Some by their monarchs fatal mercy grown
From pardond rebels kinsmen to the throne
Were raisd in powr and public office high
Strong bands if bands ungrateful men could tie

Of these the false Achitophel was first
A name to all succeeding ages curst
For close designs and crooked counsels fit
Sagacious bold and turbulent of wit
Restless unfixt in principles and place
In powr unpleasd impatient of disgrace
A fiery soul which working out its way
Fretted the pigmy-body to decay
And oer informd the tenement of clay
A daring pilot in extremity
Pleasd with the danger when the waves went high
He sought the storms but for a calm unfit
Would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit
Great wits are sure to madness near allid
And thin partitions do their bounds divide
Else why should he with wealth and honour blest
Refuse his age the needful hours of rest
Punish a body which he could not please
Bankrupt of life yet prodigal of ease
And all to leave what with his toil he won
To that unfeatherd two-leggd thing a son
Got while his soul did huddled notions try
And born a shapeless lump like anarchy
In friendship false implacable in hate
Resolvd to ruin or to rule the state
To compass this the triple bond he broke
The pillars of the public safety shook
And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke
Then seizd with fear yet still affecting fame
Usurpd a patriots all-atoning name
So easy still it proves in factious times
With public zeal to cancel private crimes
How safe is treason and how sacred ill
Where none can sin against the peoples will
Where crowds can wink and no offence be known
Since in anothers guilt they find their own
Yet fame deservd no enemy can grudge
The statesman we abhor but praise the judge
In Jewish courts neer sat an Abbethdin
With more discerning eyes or hands more clean
Unbribd unsought the wretched to redress
Swift of dispatch and easy of access
Oh had he been content to serve the crown
With virtues only proper to the gown
Or had the rankness of the soil been freed
From cockle that opprest the noble seed
David for him his tuneful harp had strung
And heavn had wanted one immortal song
But wild ambition loves to slide not stand
And fortunes ice prefers to virtues land
Achitophel grown weary to possess
A lawful fame and lazy happiness
Disdaind the golden fruit to gather free
And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree
Now manifest of crimes contrivd long since
He stood at bold defiance with his prince
Held up the buckler of the peoples cause
Against the crown and skulkd behind the laws
The wishd occasion of the plot he takes
Some circumstances finds but more he makes
By buzzing emissaries fills the ears
Of listning crowds with jealousies and fears
Of arbitrary counsels brought to light
And proves the king himself a Jebusite
Weak arguments which yet he knew full well
Were strong with people easy to rebel
For governd by the moon the giddy Jews
Tread the same track when she the prime renews
And once in twenty years their scribes record
By natural instinct they change their lord
Achitophel still wants a chief and none
Was found so fit as warlike Absalom
Not that he wishd his greatness to create
For politicians neither love nor hate
But for he knew his title not allowd
Would keep him still depending on the crowd
That kingly powr thus ebbing out might be
Drawn to the dregs of a democracy
Him he attempts with studied arts to please
And sheds his venom in such words as these

Auspicious Prince at whose nativity
Some royal planet ruld the southern sky
Thy longing countrys darling and desire
Their cloudy pillar and their guardian fire
Their second Moses whose extended wand
Divides the seas and shows the promisd land
Whose dawning day in very distant age
Has exercisd the sacred prophets rage
The peoples prayr the glad diviners theme
The young mens vision and the old mens dream
Thee Saviour thee the nations vows confess
And never satisfid with seeing bless
Swift unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim
And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name
How long wilt thou the general joy detain
Starve and defraud the people of thy reign
Content ingloriously to pass thy days
Like one of virtues fools that feeds on praise
Till thy fresh glories which now shine so bright
Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight
Believe me royal youth thy fruit must be
Or gatherd ripe or rot upon the tree
Heavn has to all allotted soon or late
Some lucky revolution of their fate
Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill
For human good depends on human will
Our fortune rolls as from a smooth descent
And from the first impression takes the bent
But if unseizd she glides away like wind
And leaves repenting folly far behind
Now now she meets you with a glorious prize
And spreads her locks before her as she flies
Had thus Old David from whose loins you spring
Not dard when fortune calld him to be king
At Gath an exile he might still remain
And Heavens anointing oil had been in vain
Let his successful youth your hopes engage
But shun thexample of declining age
Behold him setting in his western skies
The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise
He is not now as when on Jordans sand
The joyful people throngd to see him land
Covring the beach and blackning all the strand
But like the Prince of Angels from his height
Comes tumbling downward with diminishd light
Betrayd by one poor plot to public scorn
Our only blessing since his curst return
Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind
Blown off and scatterd by a puff of wind
What strength can he to your designs oppose
Naked of friends and round beset with foes
If Pharaohs doubtful succour he should use
A foreign aid would more incense the Jews
Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring
Foment the war but not support the king
Nor would the royal party eer unite
With Pharaohs arms tassist the Jebusite
Or if they should their interest soon would break
And with such odious aid make David weak
All sorts of men by my successful arts
Abhorring kings estrange their alterd hearts
From Davids rule And tis the general Cry
Religion Common-wealth and Liberty
If you as champion of the public good
Add to their arms a chief of royal blood
What may not Israel hope and what applause
Might such a general gain by such a cause
Not barren praise alone that gaudy flowr
Fair only to the sight but solid powr
And nobler is a limited command
Givn by the love of all your native land
Than a successive title long and dark
Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noahs Ark

What cannot praise effect in mighty minds
When flattery soothes and when ambition blinds
Desire of powr on earth a vicious weed
Yet sprung from high is of celestial seed
In God tis glory And when men aspire
Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire
Th ambitious youth too covetous of fame
Too full of angels metal in his frame
Unwarily was led from virtues ways
Made drunk with honour and debauchd with praise
Half loath and half consenting to the ill
For loyal blood within him struggled still
He thus replid—And what pretence have I
To take up arms for public liberty
My Father governs with unquestiond right
The Faiths defender and mankinds delight
Good gracious just observant of the laws
And Heavn by wonders has espousd his cause
Whom has he wrongd in all his peaceful reign
Who sues for justice to his throne in vain
What millions has he pardond of his foes
Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose
Mild easy humble studious of our good
Inclind to mercy and averse from blood
If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit
His crime is Gods beloved attribute
What could he gain his people to betray
Or change his right for arbitrary sway
Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign
His fruitful Nile and yoke a servile train
If Davids rule Jerusalem displease
The Dog-star heats their brains to this disease
Why then should I encouraging the bad
Turn rebel and run popularly mad
Were he a tyrant who by lawless might
Oppressd the Jews and raisd the Jebusite
Well might I mourn but natures holy bands
Would curb my spirits and restrain my hands
The people might assert their liberty
But what was right in them were crime in me
His favour leaves me nothing to require
Prevents my wishes and out-runs desire
What more can I expect while David lives
All but his kingly diadem he gives
And that but there he pausd then sighing said
Is justly destind for a worthier head
For when my father from his toils shall rest
And late augment the number of the blest
His lawful issue shall the throne ascend
Or the collatral line where that shall end
His brother though oppressd with vulgar spite
Yet dauntless and secure of native right
Of every royal virtue stands possessd
Still dear to all the bravest and the best
His courage foes his friends his truth proclaim
His loyalty the king the world his fame
His mercy evn thoffending crowd will find
For sure he comes of a forgiving kind
Why should I then repine at Heavens decree
Which gives me no pretence to royalty
Yet oh that Fate propitiously inclind
Had raisd my birth or had debasd my mind
To my large soul not all her treasure lent
And then betrayd it to a mean descent
I find I find my mounting spirits bold
And Davids part disdains my mothers mold
Why am I scanted by a niggard-birth
My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth
And made for empire whispers me within
Desire of greatness is a god-like sin

Him staggering so when Hells dire agent found
While fainting virtue scarce maintaind her ground
He pours fresh forces in and thus replies

Theternal God supremely good and wise
Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain
What wonders are reservd to bless your reign
Against your will your arguments have shown
Such virtues only givn to guide a throne
Not that your fathers mildness I contemn
But manly force becomes the diadem
Tis true he grants the people all they crave
And more perhaps than subjects ought to have
For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame
And more his goodness than his wit proclaim
But when should people strive their bonds to break
If not when kings are negligent or weak
Let him give on till he can give no more
The thrifty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor
And every shekel which he can receive
Shall cost a limb of his prerogative
To ply him with new plots shall be my care
Or plunge him deep in some expensive war
Which when his treasure can no more supply
He must with the remains of kingship buy
His faithful friends our jealousies and fears
Call Jebusites and Pharaohs pensioners
Whom when our fury from his aid has torn
He shall be naked left to public scorn
The next successor whom I fear and hate
My arts have made obnoxious to the state
Turnd all his virtues to his overthrow
And gaind our elders to pronounce a foe
His right for sums of necessary gold
Shall first be pawnd and afterwards be sold
Till time shall ever-wanting David draw
To pass your doubtful title into law
If not the people have a right supreme
To make their kings for kings are made for them
All empire is no more than powr in trust
Which when resumd can be no longer just
Succession for the general good designd
In its own wrong a nation cannot bind
If altering that the people can relieve
Better one suffer than a nation grieve
The Jews well know their powr ere Saul they chose
God was their king and God they durst depose
Urge now your piety your filial name
A fathers right and fear of future fame
The public good the universal call
To which even Heavn submitted answers all
Nor let his love enchant your generous mind
Tis Natures trick to propagate her kind
Our fond begetters who would never die
Love but themselves in their posterity
Or let his kindness by theffects be trid
Or let him lay his vain pretence aside
God said he lovd your father could he bring
A better proof than to anoint him king
It surely showd he lovd the shepherd well
Who gave so fair a flock as Israel
Would David have you thought his darling son
What means he then to alienate the crown
The name of godly he may blush to bear
Tis after Gods own heart to cheat his heir
He to his brother gives supreme command
To you a legacy of barren land
Perhaps thold harp on which he thrums his lays
Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise
Then the next heir a prince severe and wise
Already looks on you with jealous eyes
Sees through the thin disguises of your arts
And marks your progress in the peoples hearts
Though now his mighty soul in grief contains
He meditates revenge who least complains
And like a lion slumbring in the way
Or sleep-dissembling while he waits his prey
His fearless foes within his distance draws
Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws
Till at the last his time for fury found
He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground
The prostrate vulgar passes oer and spares
But with a lordly rage his hunters tears
Your case no tame expedients will afford
Resolve on death or conquest by the sword
Which for no less a stake than life you draw
And self-defence is Natures eldest law
Leave the warm people no considering time
For then rebellion may be thought a crime
Prevail yourself of what occasion gives
But try your title while your father lives
And that your arms may have a fair pretence
Proclaim you take them in the kings defence
Whose sacred life each minute would expose
To plots from seeming friends and secret foes
And who can sound the depth of Davids soul
Perhaps his fear his kindness may control
He fears his brother though he loves his son
For plighted vows too late to be undone
If so by force he wishes to be gaind
Like womens lechery to seem constraind
Doubt not but when he most affects the frown
Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown
Secure his person to secure your cause
They who possess the prince possess the laws

He said and this advice above the rest
With Absaloms mild nature suited best
Unblamd of life ambition set aside
Not staind with cruelty nor puffd with pride
How happy had he been if destiny
Had higher placd his birth or not so high
His kingly virtues might have claimd a throne
And blest all other countries but his own
But charming greatness since so few refuse
Tis juster to lament him than accuse
Strong were his hopes a rival to remove
With blandishments to gain the public love
To head the faction while their zeal was hot
And popularly prosecute the plot
To farther this Achitophel unites
The malcontents of all the Israelites
Whose differing parties he could wisely join
For several ends to serve the same design
The best and of the princes some were such
Who thought the powr of monarchy too much
Mistaken men and patriots in their hearts
Not wicked but seducd by impious arts
By these the springs of property were bent
And wound so high they crackd the government
The next for interest sought tembroil the state
To sell their duty at a dearer rate
And make their Jewish markets of the throne
Pretending public good to serve their own
Others thought kings an useless heavy load
Who cost too much and did too little good
These were for laying honest David by
On principles of pure good husbandry
With them joind all thharanguers of the throng
That thought to get preferment by the tongue
Who follow next a double danger bring
Not only hating David but the king
The Solymaean rout well versd of old
In godly faction and in treason bold
Cowring and quaking at a conqurors sword
But lofty to a lawful prince restord
Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun
And scornd by Jebusites to be out-done
Hot Levites headed these who pulld before
From thArk which in the Judges days they bore
Resumd their Cant and with a zealous cry
Pursud their old belovd Theocracy
Where Sanhedrin and Priest enslavd the nation
And justifid their spoils by inspiration
For who so fit for reign as Aarons race
If once dominion they could found in Grace
These led the pack though not of surest scent
Yet deepest mouthd against the government
A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed
Of the true old enthusiastic breed
Gainst form and order they their powr employ
Nothing to build and all things to destroy
But far more numerous was the herd of such
Who think too little and who talk too much
These out of mere instinct they knew not why
Adord their fathers God and property
And by the same blind benefit of fate
The Devil and the Jebusite did hate
Born to be saved even in their own despite
Because they could not help believing right
Such were the tools but a whole Hydra more
Remains of sprouting heads too long to score
Some of their chiefs were princes of the land
In the first rank of these did Zimri stand
A man so various that he seemd to be
Not one but all Mankinds Epitome
Stiff in opinions always in the wrong
Was everything by starts and nothing long
But in the course of one revolving moon
Was chemist fiddler statesman and buffoon
Then all for women painting rhyming drinking
Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking
Blest madman who could every hour employ
With something new to wish or to enjoy
Railing and praising were his usual themes
And both to show his judgment in extremes
So over violent or over civil
That every man with him was god or devil
In squandering wealth was his peculiar art
Nothing went unrewarded but desert
Beggard by fools whom still he found too late
He had his jest and they had his estate
He laughd himself from court then sought relief
By forming parties but could neer be chief
For spite of him the weight of business fell
On Absalom and wise Achitophel
Thus wicked but in will of means bereft
He left not faction but of that was left

Titles and names twere tedious to rehearse
Of lords below the dignity of verse
Wits warriors commonwealths-men were the best
Kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest
And therefore in the name of dullness be
The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free
And canting Nadab let oblivion damn
Who made new porridge for the Paschal Lamb
Let friendships holy band some names assure
Some their own worth and some let scorn secure
Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place
Whom kings no titles gave and God no grace
Not bull-faced Jonas who could statutes draw
To mean rebellion and make treason law
But he though bad is followd by a worse
The wretch who Heavns Anointed dard to curse
Shimei whose youth did early promise bring
Of zeal to God and hatred to his king
Did wisely from expensive sins refrain
And never broke the Sabbath but for gain
Nor ever was he known an oath to vent
Or curse unless against the government
Thus heaping wealth by the most ready way
Among the Jews which was to cheat and pray
The city to reward his pious hate
Against his master chose him magistrate
His hand a vare of justice did uphold
His neck was loaded with a chain of gold
During his office treason was no crime
The sons of Belial had a glorious time
For Shimei though not prodigal of pelf
Yet lovd his wicked neighbour as himself
When two or three were gatherd to declaim
Against the monarch of Jerusalem
Shimei was always in the midst of them
And if they curst the king when he was by
Would rather curse than break good company
If any durst his factious friends accuse
He packd a jury of dissenting Jews
Whose fellow-feeling in the godly cause
Would free the suffring saint from human laws
For laws are only made to punish those
Who serve the king and to protect his foes
If any leisure time he had from powr
Because tis sin to mis-employ an hour
His busness was by writing to persuade
That kings were useless and a clog to trade
And that his noble style he might refine
No Rechabite more shunnd the fumes of wine
Chaste were his cellars and his shrieval board
The grossness of a city feast abhorrd
His cooks with long disuse their trade forgot
Cool was his kitchen though his brains were hot
Such frugal virtue malice may accuse
But sure twas necessary to the Jews
For towns once burnt such magistrates require
As dare not tempt Gods providence by fire
With spiritual food he fed his servants well
But free from flesh that made the Jews rebel
And Moses laws he held in more account
For forty days of fasting in the mount
To speak the rest who better are forgot
Would tire a well-breathd witness of the plot
Yet Corah thou shalt from oblivion pass
Erect thyself thou monumental brass
High as the serpent of thy metal made
While nations stand secure beneath thy shade
What though his birth were base yet comets rise
From earthy vapours eer they shine in skies
Prodigious actions may as well be done
By weavers issue as by princes son
This arch-attestor for the public good
By that one deed ennobles all his blood
Who ever askd the witnesses high race
Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace
Ours was a Levite and as times went then
His tribe were God-almightys gentlemen
Sunk were his eyes his voice was harsh and loud
Sure signs he neither choleric was nor proud
His long chin provd his wit his saint-like grace
A church vermilion and a Moses face
His memory miraculously great
Could plots exceeding mans belief repeat
Which therefore cannot be accounted lies
For human wit could never such devise
Some future truths are mingled in his book
But where the witness faild the Prophet spoke
Some things like visionary flights appear
The spirit caught him up the Lord knows where
And gave him his rabbinical degree
Unknown to foreign university
His judgment yet his memry did excel
Which piecd his wondrous evidence so well
And suited to the temper of the times
Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes
Let Israels foes suspect his Heavnly call
And rashly judge his writ apocryphal
Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made
He takes his life who takes away his trade
Were I myself in witness Corahs place
The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace
Should whet my memory though once forgot
To make him an appendix of my plot
His zeal to Heavn made him his prince despise
And load his person with indignities
But Zeal peculiar privilege affords
Indulging latitude to deeds and words
And Corah might for Agags murther call
In terms as coarse as Samuel usd to Saul
What others in his evidence did join
The best that could be had for love or coin
In Corahs own predicament will fall
For Witness is a common name to all

Surrounded thus with friends of every sort
Deluded Absalom forsakes the court
Impatient of high hopes urgd with renown
And fird with near possession of a crown
Th admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise
And on his goodly person feed their eyes
His joy conceald he sets himself to show
On each side bowing popularly low
His looks his gestures and his words he frames
And with familiar ease repeats their names
Thus formd by Nature furnishd out with arts
He glides unfelt into their secret hearts
Then with a kind compassionating look
And sighs bespeaking pity eer he spoke
Few words he said but easy those and fit
More slow than Hybla drops and far more sweet

I mourn my country-men your lost estate
Though far unable to prevent your fate
Behold a banishd man for your dear cause
Exposd a prey to arbitrary laws
Yet oh that I alone could be undone
Cut off from empire and no more a son
Now all your liberties a spoil are made
Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade
And Jebusites your sacred rites invade
My father whom with reverence yet I name
Charmd into ease is careless of his fame
And bribd with petty sums of foreign gold
Is grown in Bathshebas embraces old
Exalts his enemies his friends destroys
And all his powr against himself employs
He gives and let him give my right away
But why should he his own and yours betray
He only he can make the nation bleed
And he alone from my revenge is freed
Take then my tears with that he wipd his eyes
Tis all the aid my present powr supplies
No court-informer can these arms accuse
These arms may sons against their fathers use
And tis my wish the next successors reign
May make no other Israelite complain

Youth beauty graceful action seldom fail
But common interest always will prevail
And pity never ceases to be shown
To him who makes the peoples wrongs his own
The crowd that still believe their kings oppress
With lifted hands their young Messiah bless
Who now begins his progress to ordain
With chariots horsemen and a numrous train
From East to West his glories he displays
And like the sun the Promisd Land surveys
Fame runs before him as the Morning-Star
And shouts of joy salute him from afar
Each house receives him as a guardian God
And consecrates the place of his abode
But hospitable treats did most commend
Wise Issachar his wealthy western friend
This moving court that caught the peoples eyes
And seemd but pomp did other ends disguise
Achitophel had formd it with intent
To sound the depths and fathom where it went
The peoples hearts distinguish friends from foes
And try their strength before they came to blows
Yet all was colourd with a smooth pretence
Of specious love and duty to their prince
Religion and redress of grievances
Two names that always cheat and always please
Are often urgd and good King Davids life
Endangerd by a brother and a wife
Thus in a pageant show a plot is made
And peace itself is war in masquerade
Oh foolish Israel never warnd by ill
Still the same bait and circumvented still
Did ever men forsake their present ease
In midst of health imagine a disease
Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee
Make heirs for monarchs and for God decree
What shall we think Can people give away
Both for themselves and sons their native sway
Then they are left defenceless to the sword
Of each unbounded arbitrary lord
And laws are vain by which we right enjoy
If kings unquestiond can those laws destroy
Yet if the crowd be judge of fit and just
And kings are only officers in trust
Then this resuming covnant was declard
When Kings were made or is for ever bard
If those who gave the sceptre could not tie
By their own deed their own posterity
How then could Adam bind his future race
How could his forfeit on mankind take place
Or how could heavenly justice damn us all
Who neer consented to our fathers fall
Then kings are slaves to those whom they command
And tenants to their peoples pleasure stand
Add that the powr for property allowd
Is mischievously seated in the crowd
For who can be secure of private right
If sovereign sway may be dissolvd by might
Nor is the peoples judgment always true
The most may err as grossly as the few
And faultless kings run down by common cry
For vice oppression and for tyranny
What standard is there in a fickle rout
Which flowing to the mark runs faster out
Nor only crowds but Sanhedrins may be
Infected with this public lunacy
And share the madness of rebellious times
To murther monarchs for imagind crimes
If they may give and take wheneer they please
Not kings alone the godheads images
But government itself at length must fall
To natures state where all have right to all
Yet grant our lords the people kings can make
What prudent men a settled throne would shake
For whatsoeer their sufferings were before
That change they covet makes them suffer more
All other errors but disturb a state
But innovation is the blow of fate
If ancient fabrics nod and threat to fall
To patch the flaws and buttress up the wall
Thus far tis duty but here fix the mark
For all beyond it is to touch our Ark
To change foundations cast the frame anew
Is work for rebels who base ends pursue
At once divine and human laws control
And mend the parts by ruin of the whole
The tampring world is subject to this curse
To physic their disease into a worse

Now what relief can righteous David bring
How fatal tis to be too good a king
Friends he has few so high the madness grows
Who dare be such must be the peoples foes
Yet some there were evn in the worst of days
Some let me name and naming is to praise

In this short file Barzillai first appears
Barzillai crownd with honour and with years
Long since the rising rebels he withstood
In regions waste beyond the Jordans flood
Unfortunately brave to buoy the state
But sinking underneath his masters fate
In exile with his god-like prince he mournd
For him he sufferd and with him returnd
The court he practisd not the courtiers art
Large was his wealth but larger was his heart
Which well the noblest objects knew to choose
The fighting warrior and recording Muse
His bed could once a fruitful issue boast
Now more than half a fathers name is lost
His eldest hope with every grace adornd
By me so Heavn will have it always mournd
And always honourd snatchd in manhoods prime
B unequal Fates and Providences crime
Yet not before the goal of honour won
All parts fulfilld of subject and of son
Swift was the race but short the time to run
Oh narrow circle but of powr divine
Scanted in space but perfect in thy line
By sea by land thy matchless worth was known
Arms thy delight and war was all thy own
Thy force infusd the fainting Tyrians proppd
And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stoppd
Oh ancient honour Oh unconquerd Hand
Whom foes unpunishd never could withstand
But Israel was unworthy of thy name
Short is the date of all immoderate fame
It looks as Heavn our ruin had designd
And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind
Now free from earth thy disencumberd Soul
Mounts up and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole
From thence thy kindred legions mayst thou bring
To aid the Guardian Angel of thy king
Here stop my Muse here cease thy painful flight
No pinions can pursue immortal height
Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more
And tell thy soul she should have fled before
Or fled she with his life and left this verse
To hang on her departed patrons hearse
Now take thy steepy flight from Heavn and see
If thou canst find on earth another he
Another he would be too hard to find
See then whom thou canst see not far behind
Zadoc the priest whom shunning powr and place
His lowly mind advancd to Davids grace
With him the Sagan of Jerusalem
Of hospitable soul and noble stem
Him of the western dome whose weighty sense
Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence
The Prophets sons by such example led
To learning and to loyalty were bred
For colleges on bounteous kings depend
And never rebel was to arts a friend
To these succeed the pillars of the laws
Who best could plead and best can judge a cause
Next them a train of loyal peers ascend
Sharp judging Adriel the Muses friend
Himself a Muse—in Sanhedrins debate
True to his prince but not a slave of state
Whom Davids love with honours did adorn
That from his disobedient son were torn
Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought
Endowd by Nature and by learning taught
To move assemblies who but only trid
The worse awhile then chose the better side
Nor chose alone but turnd the balance too
So much the weight of one brave man can do
Hushai the friend of David in distress
In public storms of manly steadfastness
By foreign treaties he informd his youth
And joind experience to his native truth
His frugal care supplid the wanting throne
Frugal for that but bounteous of his own
Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow
But hard the task to manage well the low
For sovereign power is too depressd or high
When kings are forcd to sell or crowds to buy
Indulge one labour more my weary Muse
For Amiel who can Amiels praise refuse
Of ancient race by birth but nobler yet
In his own worth and without title great
The Sanhedrin long time as chief he ruld
Their reason guided and their passion coold
So dextrous was he in the crowns defence
So formd to speak a loyal nations sense
That as their band was Israels tribes in small
So fit was he to represent them all
Now rasher charioteers the seat ascend
Whose loose careers his steady skill commend
They like thunequal ruler of the day
Misguide the seasons and mistake the way
While he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles
And safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils

These were the chief a small but faithful band
Of worthies in the breach who dard to stand
And tempt thunited fury of the land
With grief they viewd such powerful engines bent
To batter down the lawful government
A numerous faction with pretended frights
In Sanhedrins to plume the regal rights
The true successor from the court removd
The plot by hireling witnesses improvd
These ills they saw and as their duty bound
They showd the king the danger of the wound
That no concessions from the throne would please
But lenitives fomented the disease
That Absalom ambitious of the crown
Was made the lure to draw the people down
That false Achitophels pernicious hate
Had turnd the plot to ruin church and state
The Council violent the rabble worse
That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse

With all these loads of injuries opprest
And long revolving in his careful breast
Thevent of things at last his patience tird
Thus from his royal throne by Heavn inspird
The god-like David spoke and awful fear
His train their Maker in their Master hear

Thus long have I by native mercy swayd
My wrongs dissembld my revenge delayd
So willing to forgive thoffending age
So much the father did the king assuage
But now so far my clemency they slight
Th offenders question my forgiving right
That one was made for many they contend
But tis to rule for thats a monarchs end
They call my tenderness of blood my fear
Though manly tempers can the longest bear
Yet since they will divert my native course
Tis time to shew I am not good by force
Those heapd affronts that haughty subjects bring
Are burdens for a camel not a king
Kings are the public pillars of the state
Born to sustain and prop the nations weight
If my young Sampson will pretend a call
To shake the column let him share the fall
But oh that yet he would repent and live
How easy tis for parents to forgive
With how few tears a pardon might be won
From Nature pleading for a darling son
Poor pitied youth by my paternal care
Raisd up to all the heights his frame could bear
Had God ordaind his fate for empire born
He would have givn his soul another turn
Gulld with a patriots name whose modern sense
Is one that would by law supplant his prince
The peoples brave the politicians tool
Never was patriot yet but was a fool
Whence comes it that religion and the laws
Should more be Absaloms than Davids cause
His old instructor eer he lost his place
Was never thought endued with so much grace
Good heavns how faction can a patriot paint
My rebel ever proves my peoples saint
Would
they
impose an heir upon the throne
Let Sanhedrins be taught to give their own
A kings at least a part of government
And mine as requisite as their consent
Without my leave a future king to choose
Infers a right the present to depose
True they petition me tapprove their choice
But Esaus hands suit ill with Jacobs voice
My pious subjects for my safety pray
Which to secure they take my powr away
From plots and treasons Heavn preserve my years
But save me most from my petitioners
Unsatiate as the barren womb or grave
God cannot grant so much as they can crave
What then is left but with a jealous eye
To guard the small remains of royalty
The law shall still direct my peaceful sway
And the same law teach rebels to obey
Votes shall no more establishd powr control
Such votes as make a part exceed the whole
No groundless clamours shall my friends remove
Nor crowds have powr to punish ere they prove
For gods and god-like kings their care express
Still to defend their servants in distress
Oh that my powr to saving were confind
Why am I forcd like Heavn against my mind
To make examples of another kind
Must I at length the sword of justice draw
Oh curst effects of necessary law
How ill my fear they by my mercy scan
Beware the fury of a patient man
Law they require let law then show her face
They could not be content to look on grace
Her hinder parts but with a daring eye
To tempt the terror of her front and die
By their own arts tis righteously decreed
Those dire artificers of death shall bleed
Against themselves their witnesses will swear
Till viper-like their mother plot they tear
And suck for nutriment that bloody gore
Which was their principle of life before
Their Belial with the Belzebub will fight
Thus on my foes my foes shall do me right

Nor doubt thevent for factious crowds engage
In their first onset all their brutal rage
Then let em take an unresisted course
Retire and traverse and delude their force
But when they stand all breathless urge the fight
And rise upon em with redoubled might
For lawful powr is still superior found
When long drivn back at length it stands the ground

He said Th Almighty nodding gave consent
And peals of thunder shook the firmament
Henceforth a series of new time began
The mighty years in long procession ran
Once more the god-like David was restord
And willing nations knew their lawful lord"
Forrest GanderAbscess"Good morning kiss Their teeth glance Clack of June
bugs against pane On the porch a young man
in the full sun rocking
Jars incubate tomato plants His mother sweeps the dirt
yard away from flowering vinca and bottle tree
Straightens up one-eyed by ragged hens As her boy
ambles away to the steady pulse
in his skull
The cattle gate
swinging open behind him
She takes a headache powder
and it is nineteen and twenty seven
The James overruns its levee backs up
the Blackwater Nineteen and twenty nine she reads his postcard
the tobacco crop burns Nineteen and thirty drought
Long limp bags drag through fields The Lord whistles
for the fly Revival tents threaten a rain
of scorpions To cure her hiccups
the woman sees a hypnotist Promptly
coughs herself to death In pungs marked men ride The son
is blown away No one returns in this story No one escapes
The tribe is glued together for ruination friends
There is no more time there is no way out"
Valerie Martínez"Absence Luminescent""I

Arch inverted white peony
and stamens yellow Center
of the body Imagines
Who is absent

Fingers in my mouth—memory
Dragonfly so blue in the head
Orange as fire in the body

Wings transparence Disappearing arms

The space where he was Aureole
The space he is she was
And the opposite

Defines the dragon which flies
Iridescent where it was
Echo of hued wings

II

Heat at the center
Heat where she was
Lack of passion
where the torso
wont go No path
through what is occupied
Space

Falls in a delicate arch sees
own soul Cadaver as shrine
concavity

So white Says white flesh
and no spirit

And touching the dead
And touching what is not

If you musta black hole Thus the message of blackness
clearly indicating the coordinates of nothingness

Gods face Who sees it
Child trying trying

Absent star perforation in there

Of all the tendernesses at the end there was that bouquet of

Gisela Kraftabsence or a record of the creation of a fabulous animal"on the first day you were beautiful and good
on the second you grew a horn
on the third a lead-gray wing budded
from your shoulder
on the fourth a claw sprouted from your shoe
on the fifth you flew
right into my armpit
built a nest and then lost interest
on the sixth you were a host of leeches
having their way with my veins
on the seventh I heard you
trotting above me with hollow hoof beats
on the eighth you went to moses to ask for advice
winged horned buraq the prophet’s steed
returned as a lamb on the ninth
to graze on my belly fur
on the tenth you died for isaac
the angel decided in favor of animal testing
on the eleventh I had forgotten the color of your eyes
on the twelfth day you were poor and naked
on the thirteenth you were lying on the bottom of the sea
a millions of eons old whispering mussel
on the fourteenth they called you into the field
duldul ali’s tireless gray mule
on the fifteenth you stood still
welded on the lip of a kettle
the sweat of the holy brew had oxidized
your copper neck
on the sixteenth you were the primordial ox
zarathustra sang of your suffering
on the seventeenth day when I came home
you were once again the one human being"

“Even when you are not in a room
you are in it your voice everywhere”–Bill Holm

The message that’s recorded on the phone
is unmistakably bad news and then
another call tells us it’s one we love—
a sudden death while traveling somehow
appropriate for one who always
seized life too completely to stand still

A door slams shut a wall has dropped away
and once again I’m driven back to
empty pages insufficient words
to rooms he always filled on entering—
rooms lined with books piano music and
good friends who raise their glasses one last time

And now as all the lights are blinking off
in every prairie town we’ve ever loved
when all the toasts are made and songs are sung
when leaving is the only certainty
a single voice keeps echoing along
each dark untraveled hallway of the heart"
Donald JusticeAbsences"Its snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers
There is only this sound of falling quiet and remote
Like the memory of scales descending the white keys
Of a childhood piano—outside the window palms
And the heavy head of the cereus inclining
Soon to let down its white or yellow-white

Now only these poor snow-flowers in a heap
Like the memory of a white dress cast down   
So much has fallen
And I who have listened for a step
All afternoon hear it now but already falling away
Already in memory And the terrible scales descending
On the silent piano the snow and the absent flowers
abounding"
Ron PadgettThe Absolutely Huge and Incredible Injustice in the World"What makes us so mean
We are meaner than gorillas
the ones we like to blame our genetic aggression on
It is in our nature to hide behind what Darwin said about survival
as if survival were the most important thing on earth
It isnt
You know—surely it has occurred to you—
that there is no way that humankind will survive
another million years Well be lucky to be around
another five hundred Why
Because we are so mean
that we would rather kill everyone and everything on earth
than let anybody get the better of us
""Give me liberty or give me death""
Why didnt he just say ""Grrr lets kill each other""

A nosegay of pansies leans toward us in a glass of water
on a white tablecloth bright in the sunlight
at the ocean where children are frolicking
then looking around and wondering—
about what we cannot say for we are imagining
how we would kill the disgusting man and woman
at the next table Tonight we could throw an electrical storm
into their bed No more would they spit on the veranda
Actually they arent that bad its just
that I am talking mean in order to be more
like my fellow humans—its lonely feeling like a saint
which I do one second every five weeks
but that one second is so intense I cant stand up
and then I figure out that its ersatz I cant be a saint
I am not even a religious person I am hardly a person at all
except when I look at you and think
that this life with you must go on forever
because it is so perfect with all its imperfections
like your waistline that exists a little too much
like my hairline that doesnt exist at all
Which means that my bald head feels good
on your soft round belly that feels good too
If only everyone were us

But sometimes we are everyone we get mad
at the world and mean as all get-out
which means we want to tell the world to get out
of this our world Who are all these awful people
Why its your own grandma who was so nice to you—
you mistook her for someone else She actually was
someone else but you had no way of knowing that
just as you had no way of knowing that the taxi driver
saves his pennies all year
to go to Paris for Racine at the Comédie Francaise
Now he is reciting a long speech in French from Andromache
and you arrive at the corner of This and That
and though Andromaches noble husband Hector has been killed
and his corpse has been dragged around the walls of Troy by an
unusually mean Achilles
although she is forced into slavery and a marriage
to save the life of her son and then people around her
get killed commit suicide and go crazy the driver is in paradise
he has taken you back to his very mean teacher
in the unhappy school in Port-au-Prince and then
to Paris and back to the French language of the seventeenth century
and then to ancient Greece and then to the corner of This and That
Only a mean world would have this man driving around in a city
where for no reason someone is going to fire a bullet into the back of
his head

It was an act of kindness
on the part of the person who placed both numbers and letters
on the dial of the phone so we could call WAverly
ATwater CAnareggio BLenheim and MAdison
DUnbar and OCean little worlds in themselves
we drift into as we dial and an act of cruelty
to change everything into numbers only not just phone numbers
that get longer and longer but statistical analysis
cost averaging collateral damage death by peanut
inflation rates personal identification numbers access codes
and the whole raving Raft of the Medusa
that drives out any thought of pleasantness
until you dial I-OO-MATTRES and in no time get a mattress
that is complete and comfy and almost under you
even though you didnt need one The men
come in and say Heres the mattress wheres
the bedroom And the bedroom realizes it cant run away
You cant say that the people who invented the bedroom were mean
only a bedroom could say that if it could say anything
Its a good thing that bedrooms cant talk
They might keep you up all night telling you things
you dont want to know ""Many years ago
in this very room   "" Eeek shut up I mean
please dont tell me anything Im sorry I shouted at you
And the walls subside into their somewhat foreverness
The wrecking ball will mash its grimace into the plaster and oof
down they will come lathe and layers of personal history
but the ball is not mean nor is the man who pulls the handle
that directs the ball on its pendulous course but another man
—and now a woman strides into his office and slaps his face hard
the man whose bottom line is changing its color
wants to change it back So good-bye building
where we made love laughed wept ate and watched TV
all at the same time Where our dog waited by the door
eyes fixed on the knob where a runaway stream came whooshing
down the hallway where I once expanded to fill the whole room
and then deflated just to see what it would feel like
where on Saturday mornings my infant son stood by the bedside
and sang quietly ""Wa-a-a-ke up"" to his snoozing parents

I can never leave all the kindness I have felt in this apartment
but if a big black iron wrecking ball comes flying toward me
zoop out I go For there must be
kindness somewhere else in the world
maybe even out of it though Im not crazy
about the emptiness of outer space I have to live
here with finite life and inner space and with
the horrible desire to love everything and be disappointed
the way my mother was until that moment
when she rolled her eyes toward me as best she could
and squeezed my hand when I asked ""Do you know who I am""
then let go of life

The other question was Did I know who I was

It is hard not to be appalled by existence
The pointlessness of matter turns us into cornered animals
that otherwise are placid or indifferent
we hiss and bare our fangs and attack
But how many people have felt the terror of existence
Was Genghis Khan horrified that he and everything else existed
Was Hitler or Pol Pot
Or any of the other charming figures of history
Je men doute
It was something else made them mean
Something else made Napoleon think it glorious
to cover the frozen earth with a hundred thousand bloody corpses
Something else made    oh name your monster
and his penchant for destruction
name your own period in history when a darkness swept over us
and made not existing seem like the better choice
as if the solution to hunger were to hurl oneself
into a vat of boiling radioactive carrots

Life is so awful
I hope that lion tears me to pieces

It is good that those men wearing black hoods
are going to strip off my skin and force me
to gape at my own intestines spilling down onto the floor
Please drive spikes through not only my hands and feet
but through my eyes as well
For this world is to be fled as soon as possible
via the purification of martyrdom
This from the God of Christian Love
Cupid hovers overhead perplexed
Long ago Zeus said he was tired
and went to bed if youre not going to exist
its best to be asleep
The Christian God is like a cranky two-thousand-year-old baby
whose fatigue delivers him into an endless tantrum
He will never grow up
because you cant grow up unless people listen to you
and they cant listen because they are too busy being mean
or fearing the meanness of others
How can I blame them
I too am afraid I can be jolted by an extremely violent movie
but what is really scary is that someone wanted to make the film
He is only a step away from the father
who took his eight-year-old daughter and her friend to the park
and beat and stabbed them to death Uh-oh
""He seemed like a normal guy"" said his neighbor Thelma
who refused to divulge her last name to reporters
She seemed like a normal gal just as the reporters seemed like
normal vampires
In some cultures it is normal to eat bugs or people
or to smear placenta on your face at night to buy
a car whose price would feed a village for thirty years
to waste your life and while youre at it waste everyone
elses too
Hello America It is dawn
wake up and smell yourselves
You smell normal
My father was not normal
he was a criminal a scuffler a tough guy
and though he did bad things
he was never mean
He didnt like mean people either
Sometimes he would beat them up
or chop up their shoes
I have never beaten anyone up
but it might be fun to chop up some shoes
Would you please hand me that cleaver Thelma

But Thelma is insulted by my request
even though I said please because she has the face of a cleaver
that flies through the air toward me and lodges
in my forehead ""Get it yourself
lughead"" she spits then twenty years later
she changes lughead to fuckhead
I change my name to Jughead
and go into the poetry protection program
so my poems can go out and live under assumed names
in Utah and Muskogee

Anna Chukhno looks up and sees me
through her violet Ukrainian eyes
and says Good morning most pleasantly inflected Oh
to ride in a horse-drawn carriage with her at midnight
down the wide avenues of Kiev and erase
the ditch at Babi Yar from human history
She looks up and asks How would you like that
I say In twenties and she counts them out
as if the air around her were not shattered by her beauty
and my body thus divided into zones
hands the place of metaphysics shins the area of moo
bones the cost of living and so on
Is it cruel that I cannot cover her with kisses
No it is beautiful that I cannot cover her with kisses
it is better that I walk out into the sunlight
with the blessing of having spoken with an actual goddess
who gave me four hundred dollars
And I am reassembled
as my car goes forward
into the oncoming rays of aggression
that bounce off my glasses and then
start penetrating and soon my eyes
turn into abandoned coal mines
whose canaries explode into an evil song
that echoes exactly nowhere

At least I am not in Rwanda in  or the Sudan in 
or Guantanamo or Rikers or in a ditch outside Rio
clubbed to death and mutilated No Cossack
bears down on me with sword raised and gleaming
at my Jewish neck and no time for me
to cry out ""It is only my neck that is Jewish
The rest is Russian Orthodox"" No smiling man tips back
his hat and says to his buddies ""Lets teach
this nigguh a lesson"" I dont need a lesson sir
I am Ethiopian this is my first time in your country
But you gentlemen are joking   

Prepare my cave and then kindly forget where it was
A crust of bread will suffice and a stream nearby
the chill of evening filtering in with the blind god
who is the chill of evening and who touches us
though we cant raise our hands to stroke his misty beard
in which
two hundred million stars have wink and glimmer needles

I had better go back to the bank we have
only three hundred and eighty-five dollars left
Those fifteen units of beauty went fast
As does everything
But meanness comes back right away
while kindness takes its own sweet time
and compassion is busy shimmering always a little above us and
behind
swooping down and transfusing us only when we dont expect it
and then only for a moment
How can I trap it
Allow it in and then
turn my body into steel No
The exit holes will still be there and besides
compassion doesnt need an exit it is an exit—
from the prison that each moment is
and just as each moment replaces the one before it
each jolt of meanness replaces the one before it
and pretty soon you get to like those jolts
you and millions of other dolts who like to be electrocuted
by their own feelings The hippopotamus
sits on you with no sense of pleasure he doesnt
even know you are there any more than he takes notice
of the little white bird atop his head and when
he sees you flattened against the ground
he doesnt even think Uh-oh he just trots away
with the bird still up there looking around
Saint Augustine stole the pears from his neighbors tree
and didnt apologize for thirty years by which time
his neighbor was probably dead and in no mood
for apologies Augustines mother became a saint
and then a city in California—Santa Monica
where everything exists so it can be driven past
except the hippopotamus that stands on the freeway
in the early dawn and yawns into your high beams
""Hello"" he seems to grunt ""I cant be your friend
and I cant be your enemy I am like compassion
I go on just beyond you no matter how many times
you crash into me and die because you never learned
to crash and live"" Then he ambles away
Could Saint Augustine have put on that much weight
I thought compassion makes you light
or at least have light the way it has light around it
in paintings like the one of the screwdriver
that appeared just when the screw was coming loose
from the wing of the airplane in which Santa Monica was riding into
heaven
smiling as if she had just imagined how to smile
the first smileof any saint a promise toward the perfection
of everything that is and isnt"
Siegfried SassoonAbsolution"The anguish of the earth absolves our eyes
Till beauty shines in all that we can see
War is our scourge yet war has made us wise
And fighting for our freedom we are free

Horror of wounds and anger at the foe
And loss of things desired all these must pass
We are the happy legion for we know
Times but a golden wind that shakes the grass

There was an hour when we were loth to part
From life we longed to share no less than others
Now having claimed this heritage of heart
What need we more my comrades and my brothers"
David HarsentAbstracts"RED
The skim on the surface of your soup or the cut on your plate
in the Café des Anges juices swamping the willow-pattern skiff
as she dabs her mouth with her napkin your blind blind date

leaving a smudge lipstick-and-gore though there’s still a worm
of gristle in the gap between her teeth
Mood music candlelight wine low voices in a world of harm

the creature brought down hindquarters heavy hind legs
broken by the dogs its head held up eyes wide
the tangle and drag as a gralloch knife unpegs

the bulk all slippage and seepage and the way she thumbs
a morsel into your mouth or smiles your smile
back at you lets you know that everything’s just as it seems

then back at the small hotel she strips off quicker than you
might have hoped pink as a new-skinned cat all too
eager to have you by heart Her cry tells you nothing new"
Robert BrowningAbt Vogler"Would that the structure brave the manifold music I build
Bidding my organ obey calling its keys to their work
Claiming each slave of the sound at a touch as when Solomon willed
Armies of angels that soar legions of demons that lurk
Man brute reptile fly—alien of end and of aim
Adverse each from the other heaven-high hell-deep removed—
Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name
And pile him a palace straight to pleasure the princess he loved

Would it might tarry like his the beautiful building of mine
This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise
Ah one and all how they helped would dispart now and now combine
Zealous to hasten the work heighten their master his praise
And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell
Burrow awhile and build broad on the roots of things
Then up again swim into sight having based me my palace well
Founded it fearless of flame flat on the nether springs

And another would mount and march like the excellent minion he was
Ay another and yet another one crowd but with many a crest
Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass
Eager to do and die yield each his place to the rest
For higher still and higher as a runner tips with fire
When a great illumination surprises a festal night—
Outlining round and round Romes dome from space to spire
Up the pinnacled glory reached and the pride of my soul was in sight

In sight Not half for it seemed it was certain to match mans birth
Nature in turn conceived obeying an impulse as I
And the emulous heaven yearned down made effort to reach the earth
As the earth had done her best in my passion to scale the sky
Novel splendours burst forth grew familiar and dwelt with mine
Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star
Meteor-moons balls of blaze and they did not pale nor pine
For earth had attained to heaven there was no more near nor far

Nay more for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow
Presences plain in the place or fresh from the Protoplast
Furnished for ages to come when a kindlier wind should blow
Lured now to begin and live in a house to their liking at last
Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and gone
But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new
What never had been was now what was as it shall be anon
And what is—shall I say matched both for I was made perfect too

All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul
All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth
All through music and me For think had I painted the whole
Why there it had stood to see nor the process so wonder-worth
Had I written the same made verse—still effect proceeds from cause
Ye know why the forms are fair ye hear how the tale is told
It is all triumphant art but art in obedience to laws
Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled—

But here is the finger of God a flash of the will that can
Existent behind all laws that made them and lo they are
And I know not if save in this such gift be allowed to man
That out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound but a star
Consider it well each tone of our scale in itself is nought
It is everywhere in the world—loud soft and all is said
Give it to me to use I mix it with two in my thought
And there Ye have heard and seen consider and bow the head

Well it is gone at last the palace of music I reared
Gone and the good tears start the praises that come too slow
For one is assured at first one scarce can say that he feared
That he even gave it a thought the gone thing was to go
Never to be again But many more of the kind
As good nay better perchance is this your comfort to me
To me who must be saved because I cling with my mind
To the same same self same love same God ay what was shall be

Therefore to whom turn I but to thee the ineffable Name
Builder and maker thou of houses not made with hands
What have fear of change from thee who art ever the same
Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands
There shall never be one lost good What was shall live as before
The evil is null is nought is silence implying sound
What was good shall be good with for evil so much good more
On the earth the broken arcs in the heaven a perfect round

All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist
Not its semblance but itself no beauty nor good nor power
Whose voice has gone forth but each survives for the melodist
When eternity affirms the conception of an hour
The high that proved too high the heroic for earth too hard
The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky
Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard
Enough that he heard it once we shall hear it by and by

And what is our failure here but a triumphs evidence
For the fulness of the days Have we withered or agonized
Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence
Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized
Sorrow is hard to bear and doubt is slow to clear
Each sufferer says his say his scheme of the weal and woe
But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear
The rest may reason and welcome tis we musicians know

Well it is earth with me silence resumes her reign
I will be patient and proud and soberly acquiesce
Give me the keys I feel for the common chord again
Sliding by semitones till I sink to the minor—yes
And I blunt it into a ninth and I stand on alien ground
Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep
Which hark I have dared and done for my resting-place is found
The C Major of this life so now I will try to sleep"
Paul Martínez PompaThe Abuelita Poem"I SKIN amp CORN

Her brown skin glistens as the sun
pours through the kitchen window
like gold leche After grinding
the 
nixtamal
 a word so beautifully ethnic
it must not only be italicized but underlined
to let you the reader know you’ve encountered
something beautifully ethnic she kneads
with the hands of centuries-old ancestor
spirits who magically yet realistically posses her
until the masa is smooth as a lowrider’s
chrome bumper And I know she must do this
with care because it says so on a website
that explains how to make homemade corn tortillas
So much labor for this peasant bread
this edible art birthed from Abuelitas’s
brown skin which is still glistening
in the sun


II APOLOGY

Before she died I called my abuelita
grandma I cannot remember
if she made corn tortillas from scratch
but O how she’d flip the factory fresh
El Milagros Quality Since 
on the burner bathe them in butter
amp salt for her grandchildren
How she’d knead the buttons
on the telephone order me food
from Pizza Hut I assure you
gentle reader this was done
with the spirit of Mesoamérica
ablaze in her fingertips"

restaurant customers order roast swan

instead of chicken hurled salad

instead of tossed salad while shoppers

spill through a maze of stalled trucks

and scurry around the sidewalk stalls

jammed with countless nameless things

that housewives sidestep

to surround a Japanese man

in a broad-brim hat and painted silk tie

as he demonstrates how one gadget

can cut food  different ways

and though they dont understand a word

he says they stand transfixed by his spiel

amid the fumes and noise and loud fruitvendors

dropping casual perfections of sun and rain

into bags and sacks against a backdrop

of silver towers and sea and fields

vibrant with excess that giddy farmers hail

by tossing animals large animals

into the air to be carried away

on the winds of exuberance

to the four corners of the globe

where the romping gods

bear so many attributes

theyre a bundle of incongruities

and no one takes them seriously

not even their beaming angels

who parachute drunkenly down to the shore

distracting the dogs let loose on cormorants

that ate so much they cant fly

but not the boys in the rowboat

who have caught a blowfish

tickled its belly until its about to burst

like a balloon before dropping it overboard

to watch it blow itself backward to kingdom come

nor the other children who have stopped

clamoring over the stranded whales back

to swim out underwater under the swans

grab them by the legs and yank them down

in a slow fury of bubbles and light

and then sell them to the market

John CiardiAbundance"I

Once I had  roses
Literally  roses
I was working for a florist
back in the shambling ‘Thirties
when iced skids of  roses
sold for $ at Faneuil Hall
So for $ I bought
 roses 
white and  red
for Connie’s wedding to steadiness

I strewed the church aisle whole
and the bride came walking
on roses roses all the way
The white roses and the red roses
White for the bed we had shared
Red for the bed she went to
from the abundance in her
to the fear in what she wanted
The gift was not in the roses
but in the abundance of the roses

To her
whose abundance had never wholly
been mine and could never be his
He had no gift of abundance in him
but only the penuries of sobriety
A good steady clerk most mortgageable
returning in creaking shoes over
the white and the red roses Returning
over the most flowering he would ever
touch with the most flowering I
had ever touched A feast of endings


II

This morning I passed a pushcart
heaped with white carnations
as high as if there had fallen all night
one of those thick-flaked slow windless
wondering snows that leave
shakos on fence posts polar bears
in the hedges caves in the light
and a childhood on every sill
Once twice a year partially
and once twice a lifetime perfectly

that snow falls In which I ran
like a young wolf in its blood
leaping to snap the flower-flakes
clean from the air their instant on the tongue
flat and almost dusty and not enough
to be cold But as I ran face-up
mouth open my cheeks burned
with tears and flower-melt
and my lashes were fringed with gauze
and my ears wore white piping

There is no feast but energy All men
know—have known and will remember
again and again—what food that is
for the running young wolf of the rare days
when shapes fall from the air
and may be had for the leaping
Clean in the mouth of joy Flat and dusty
And how they are instantly nothing—
a commotion in the air and in the blood
—And how they are endlessly all


III

My father’s grave the deepest cave I know
was banked with snow and lilies We stuck the dead flowers
into the snow banks dirty with sand
and trampled by digger’s boots
The flowers stiff and unbeckoning
ripped from their wires in the wind
and blew their seasons out as snow
Purer than the snow itself A last
abundance correcting our poverties

I remember the feasts of my life
their every flowing I remember
the wolf all men remember in his blood
I remember the air become
a feast of flowers And remember
his last flowers whitening winter
in an imitation of possibility
while we hunched black
in the dirtied place inside possibility
where the prayers soiled him

If ever there was a man of abundances
he lies there flowerless
at that dirty center
whose wired flowers try and try
to make the winter clean again in air
And fail And leave me raging
as the young wolf grown
from his day’s play in abundance
to the ravening of recollection
Creaking to penury over the flower-strew


IV

This morning I passed a pushcart
heaped beyond possibility
as when the sun begins again
after that long snow and the earth
is moonscaped and wonderlanded
and humped and haloed in the
light it makes an angel
on every garbage can a god
in every tree that childhood
on every sill—At a corner of the ordinary

Where is she now Instantly nothing
A penury after flower-strew Nothing
A feast of glimpses Not fact itself
but an idea of the possible in the fact
—And so the rare day comes I was again
the young wolf trembling in his blood
at the profusions heaped and haloed
in their instant next to the ordinary
And did not know myself what feast I kept
—till I said your name At once all plenty was

It is the words starve us the act that feeds
The air trembling with the white wicks
of its falling encloses us To be
perfect I suppose we must be brief
The long thing is to remember
imperfectly dirtying with gratitude
the grave of abundance O flower-banked
air-dazzling and abundant woman
though the young wolf is dead all men
know—have known and must remember—
You"

but for the biding in abeyance of her

Russell EdsonThe Academic Sigh"Some students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack He had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum
And as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer
Don’t make me too long or I’ll look kind of goofy sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer

Suddenly something snaps
What happened sighs the professor from the rack
We were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped you may have heard it 
Yes I was there Don’t you remember sighs the professor
And then we heard an academic sigh 
Yes I heard it too sighs the professor it seemed to come from the rack where I was being stretched beyond my wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum "

about deity It’s not the blizzard
it’s three days after Trinkle from thawing

Jill McDonough"Accident Mass Ave""I stopped at a red light on Mass Ave
in Boston a couple blocks away
from the bridge and a woman in a beat-up
old Buick backed into me Like cranked her wheel
rammed right into my side I drove a Chevy
pickup truck It being Boston I got out
of the car yelling swearing at this woman
a little woman whose first language was not English
But she lived and drove in Boston too so she knew
we both knew that the thing to do
is get out of the car slam the door
as hard as you fucking can and yell things like What the fuck
were you thinkingYou fucking blindWhat the fuck
is going onJesus Christ So we swore
at each other with perfect posture unnaturally angled
chins I threw my arms around sudden
jerking motions with my whole arms the backs
of my hands toward where she had hit my truck

But she hadnt hit my truck She hit
the tire no damage done Her car
was fine too We saw this while
we were yelling and then we were stuck
The next line in our little drama should have been
Look at this fucking dentIm not paying for this
shitIm calling the copslady Maybe wed throw in a
Youre in big troublesister or I just hope for your sake
theres nothing wrong with my fucking suspension that
sort of thing But there was no fucking dent There
was nothing else for us to do So I
stopped yelling and she looked at the tire shed
backed into her little eyebrows pursed
and worried She was clearly in the wrong I was enormous
and Id been acting as if Id like to hit her So I said

Welltheres nothing wrong with my carnothing wrong
with your car  are you OK She nodded and started
to cry so I put my arms around her and I held her middle
of the street Mass Ave Boston a couple blocks from the bridge
I hugged her and I said We were scaredwerent we
and she nodded and we laughed"
William MeredithAccidents of Birth"Je vois les effroyables espaces de l’Univers qui m’enferment et je me trouve attaché à un coin de cette vaste étendue sans savoir pourquoi je suis plutôt en ce lieu qu’en un autre ni pourquoi ce peu de temps qui m’est donné à vivre m’est assigné à ce point plutôt quà un autre de toute l’éternité qui m’a précédé et de toute qui me suit

—Pascal Pensées sur la religion

The approach of a man’s life out of the past is history and the approach of time out of the future is mystery Their meeting is the present and it is consciousness the only time life is alive The endless wonder of this meeting is what causes the mind in its inward liberty of a frozen morning to turn back and question and remember The world is full of places Why is it that I am here

—Wendell Berry The Long-Legged House
Spared by a car or airplane crash or
cured of malignancy people look
around with new eyes at a newly
praiseworthy world blinking eyes like these

For I’ve been brought back again from the
fine silt the mud where our atoms lie
down for long naps And I’ve also been
pardoned miraculously for years
by the lava of chance which runs down
the world’s gullies silting us back
Here I am brought back set up not yet
happened away

But it’s not this random
life only throwing its sensual
astonishments upside down on
the bloody membranes behind my eyeballs
not just me being here again old
needer looking for someone to need
but you up from the clay yourself
as luck would have it and inching
over the same little segment of earth-
ball in the same little eon to
meet in a room alive in our skins
and the whole galaxy gaping there
and the centuries whining like gnats—
you to teach me to see it to see
it with you and to offer somebody
uncomprehending impudent thanks"
Dick AllenThe Accompanist"I’ve always worried about you—the man or woman
at the piano bench

Thomas HardyAccording to the Mighty Working"I

When moiling seems at cease
In the vague void of night-time
And heavens wide roomage stormless
Between the dusk and light-time

Peace this hid riot Change
This revel of quick-cued mumming
This never truly being
This evermore becoming
This spinners wheel onfleeing
Outside perceptions range"
Veronica Forrest-ThomsonAccording to the Script"Encounter with a friend acquaintance
or just someone in a bar
is merely a pretext to display
your theory of what you are

Absorbed in your own performance
you applaud or criticise
and only to watch your reflection
do you look into his eyes

Or if a contrast’s noticed
it’s to serve as a backcloth
useful for the setting
and to show your costume off

He thought you concentrating
when you were running through
your lines rehearsing gestures
while waiting for your cue

Still soliloquising you said goodbye
went on and never knew
that the stranger the other
had been speaking to you"
Czeslaw MiloszAccount"The history of my stupidity would fill many volumes

Some would be devoted to acting against consciousness
Like the flight of a moth which had it known
Would have tended nevertheless toward the candle’s flame

Others would deal with ways to silence anxiety
The little whisper which though it is a warning is ignored

I would deal separately with satisfaction and pride
The time when I was among their adherents
Who strut victoriously unsuspecting

But all of them would have one subject desire
If only my own—but no not at all alas
I was driven because I wanted to be like others
I was afraid of what was wild and indecent in me

The history of my stupidity will not be written
For one thing it’s late And the truth is laborious

Berkeley "
"Major Henry Livingston Jr"Account of a Visit from St Nicholas"’Twas the night before Christmas when all thro’ the house
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there
The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danc’d in their heads
And Mama in her ‘kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap —
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer
With a little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came
And he whistled and shouted and call’d them by name
“Now Dasher now Dancer now Prancer and Vixen
“On Comet on Cupid on Dunder and Blixem
“To the top of the porch to the top of the wall
“Now dash away dash away dash away all”
As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of Toys — and St Nicholas too
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound
He was dress’d all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnish’d with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys was flung on his back
And he look’d like a peddler just opening his pack
His eyes — how they twinkled his dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laugh’d like a bowl full of jelly
He was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf
And I laugh’d when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And fill’d all the stockings then turn’d with a jerk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose
He sprung to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight —
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night"
William E StaffordAccountability"Cold nights outside the taverns in Wyoming
pickups and big semis lounge idling letting their
haunches twitch now and then in gusts of powder snow
their owners inside for hours forgetting as well
as they can the miles the circling plains the still town

stray ribbons of pavement icy guides to nothing
but bigger towns and other taverns that glitter and wait

— Patrick Leigh Fermor
Somebody down there hates us deeply
Has planted a thorn where slightest woe may overrun

Disorderly and youthful sorrow many divots picked at since
Across the thrice-hounded comfort zone

Can’t cut it sees permanent crones
Encroaching aside likely lanes of executive tar

All spread skyward
You got the picture Bub

This world is ours no more
And those other euphemisms for grimly twisting wrath

A wire-mesh semblance bedecked
With twilight’s steamy regard

Hours where money rinses life like sex
Whichever nowadays serves as its signifier"
Katie Peterson"The Accounts
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""I

The nest was at rest for a time not being
made Before the eggs were laid it softened
The robin sleeping Inside the house
the sound of laundry
in the dryer the sound of a zipper
tumbling inside
the apparatus and shirts with buttons
as well as napkins
and a tablecloth printed with blueberries
and stalks of lily of the valley oval
for the table with claw legs
and extra leaves for guests


II

In one account the angels come their hands
emerging from their wings like sentences
staying as long as it takes
for the windows to go from indigo
to black as long
as it takes for a breath to land in the base
of the belly in the cavity
wisdom tells us wisdom comes from
or first dwells in before it navigates
the narrows of the throat becomes mantra
becomes guttural becomes spit to aspirate
the language the mouth makes
The native obligation of this account
to its subject is care The form
of music the wind chime makes
registers the commitment
of a furious system filled with
conviction to the continued
transformation of what
is Do not ask what has been
lost Ask what changed An instrument
of will the guitar echoes this a chord
more reminder than absolute the hand
arouses but does not create the scale
In this way what rests gets taken up


III

In another the mind makes a decision
to end its disorder The mind wants first
to end the face The subject
has had enough one too many
figures walking through the orchard the call
and response of conversation
become an imposition on some other world
unbroken by the idea of separate bodies
an idea one has never been convinced of
and so now it is a relief to believe
what one has suspected that separation
a trick of perspective though such a revelation
does not undo the fatigue of existing
in the continuing illusions of others And yet the obligation
to be kind to show interest in strangers
when they visit with flowers to family
whose hands are empty and to doctors
not to mention the pain


IV

In the last account the explosions
are too small to be seen and oxygen
takes both thirst and hunger away
as it ceases to find a home in the lungs
and the patient having ceased to feel ceases
to breathe as the heart shuts down
before the brain and shuts
the dreaming down the settling on a nest
of images not feeling any form of distress
The pathways to distress are blocked
but the senses doubled the ears know
the house more than they ever did
whose clothes occupy the dryer
which voice accompanies water


V

Angels be patient with this subject
I know what she would say to you
if she could speak
if she could see
you just inside the window whose top right
pane frames what we call a family
when the almost mother bird
finishes what she is thinking about
barely but still hidden from sight
If you stopped to look at the nest
you would see a sleep so purposeful
the ladder of adoration would reverse
and you would stay on earth"

Walter Savage Landor"Acon and Rhodope or Inconstancy""The Year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by
Of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve
Some froward some sedater some adorn’d
For festival some reckless of attire
The snow had left the mountain-top fresh flowers
Had withered in the meadow fig and prune
Hung wrinkling the last apple glow’d amid
Its freckled leaves and weary oxen blinkt
Between the trodden corn and twisted vine
Under whose bunches stood the empty crate
To creak ere long beneath them carried home
This was the season when twelve months before
O gentle Hamadryad true to love
Thy mansion thy dim mansion in the wood
Was blasted and laid desolate but none
Dared violate its precincts none dared pluck
The moss beneath it which alone remain’d
Of what was thine

Old Thallinos sat mute
In solitary sadness The strange tale
Not until Rhaicos died but then the whole
Echion had related whom no force
Could ever make look back upon the oaks
The father said “Echion thou must weigh
Carefully and with steady hand enough
Although no longer comes the store as once
Of wax to burn all day and night upon
That hollow stone where milk and honey lie
So may the Gods so may the dead be pleas’d”
Thallinos bore it thither in the morn
And lighted it and left it

First of those
Who visited upon this solemn day
The Hamadryad’s oak were Rhodope
And Acon of one age one hope one trust
Graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate
She sorrowed for he slender pale and first

Lapt by the flame of love his father’s lands
Were fertile herds lowed over them afar
Now stood the two aside the hollow stone
And lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak
Shivered and black and bare

“May never we
Love as they loved” said Acon She at this
Smiled for he said not what he meant to say
And thought not of its bliss but of its end
He caught the flying smile and blusht and vow’d
Nor time nor other power whereto the might
Of love hath yielded and may yield again
Should alter his

The father of the youth
Wanted not beauty for him wanted not
Song that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart
Discretion that could guide him thro’ the world
Innocence that could clear his way to heaven
Silver and gold and land not green before
The ancestral gate but purple under skies
Bending far off he wanted for his heir

Fathers have given life but virgin heart
They never gave and dare they then control
Or check it harshly dare they break a bond
Girt round it by the holiest Power on high

Acon was grieved he said grieved bitterly
But Acon had complied   ’twas dutiful

Crush thy own heart Man Man but fear to wound
The gentler that relies on thee alone
By thee created weak or strong by thee
Touch it not but for worship watch before
Its sanctuary nor leave it till are closed
The temple-doors and the last lamp is spent

Rhodope in her soul’s waste solitude
Sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea
Often not hearing it and many tears
Had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek
Meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks
Nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone
That held the milk and honey nor to lay
His plighted hand where recently ’twas laid
Opposite hers when finger playfully
Advanced and pusht back finger on each side
He did not think of this as she would do
If she were there alone

The day was hot
The moss invited him it cool’d his cheek
It cool’d his hands he thrust them into it
And sank to slumber Never was there dream
Divine as his He saw the Hamadryad
She took him by the arm and led him on
Along a valley where profusely grew
The smaller lilies with their pendent bells
And hiding under mint chill drosera
The violet shy of butting cyclamen
The feathery fern and browser of moist banks
Her offspring round her the soft strawberry
The quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk
The oleander’s light-hair’d progeny
Breathing bright freshness in each other’s face
And graceful rose bending her brow with cup

Of fragrance and of beauty boon for Gods
The fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight
His senses were bewildered and he thought
He saw again the face he most had loved
He stopt the Hamadryad at his side
Now stood between then drew him farther off
He went compliant as before but soon
Verdure had ceast altho’ the ground was smooth
Nothing was there delightful At this change
He would have spoken but his guide represt
All questioning and said

“Weak youth what brought
Thy footstep to this wood my native haunt
My life-long residence this bank where first
I sate with him   the faithful now I know
Too late the faithful Rhaicos Haste thee home
Be happy if thou canst but come no more
Where those whom death alone could sever died”

He started up the moss whereon he slept
Was dried and withered deadlier paleness spread
Over his cheek he sickened and the sire
Had land enough it held his only son"
Robert FrostAcquainted with the Night"I have been one acquainted with the night
I have walked out in rain
—
and back in rain
I have outwalked the furthest city light

I have looked down the saddest city lane
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes unwilling to explain

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street

But not to call me back or say good-bye
And further still at an unearthly height
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right
I have been one acquainted with the night"
Steven CordovaAcross a Table"“I’m glad you’re positive”
“I’m glad you’re positive

too though of course I wish
you weren’t” I wish you weren’t

either is the response I expect
and you say nothing

And who can blame you
Not me I’m not the one

who’ll call you after dinner and a movie
You’re not the one who’ll call me

We both know we have
that—what—that ultimate date

one night to come one bright morning
Who can blame us Not the forks

and not the knives that carry on
and do the heavy lifting now"
Noah WarrenAcross from the Winter Palace"Do you remember when you began to travel
It lent you this astonishing lens and you kept a journal
That rode in your breast pocket like a stone
There you wrote “Limoges — ” and “Altenkirchen”
And when you saw a peasant kissed or passed out —
Died for twenty seconds — in the heat on the hill above
Marseille you would rush out the notebook and make a note —
Sometimes just an x in the top right corner —
And ideally you would brood about that later

Which led slowly to the dark hot bar
Where you enjoy a glass of beer across from the Winter Palace in summer
In the rose-and-blue windows of the basilica
Today radiant burghers stood and learned Mercy in a circle
Around Stephen recognized
By the pebble enthroned in his skull and the scarlet ooze

While in your system the amphetamines progress
The idea is they’ll give you heart to haul yourself up and cross
The limestone plaza And when at the gate of the place
You pay you can enter the Palace"
Donald DavieAcross the Bay"A queer thing about those waters there are no
Birds there or hardly any
I did not miss them I do not remember
Missing them or thinking it uncanny

The beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone
A quarry outraged by hulls
We took pleasure in that the emptiness the hardness
Of the light the silence and the water’s stillness

But this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes
Thishurt and goes on hurting
The venomous soft jelly the undersides
We could stand the world if it were hard all over"
Sophie JewettAcross the Border"I have read somewhere that the birds of fairyland
are white as snow—W B Yeats
Where all the trees bear golden flowers
And all the birds are white
Where fairy folk in dancing hours
Burn stars for candlelight

Where every wind and leaf can talk
But no man understand
Save one whose child-feet chanced to walk
Green paths of fairyland

I followed two swift silver wings
I stalked a roving song
I startled shining silent things
I wandered all day long

But when it seemed the shadowy hours
Whispered of soft-foot night
I crept home to sweet common flowers
Brown birds and candlelight"
León SalvatierraAct"I’m going to say what love signifies
My grandfather said it was the desire of  the I for another I
And since then I began to search for you

My father said the number of  love was seven
Because creation lasted seven days
Seven days making love to its seven nights

I looked for you in each seven that ciphered my life
And I found you slipping away to other numbers

One confuses oneself with one’s other self
When two bodies intertwine in bed three loves
have been in my life four it will be when you have left
five days that I cannot stand you six kisses in La Paz Centro
seven years of not finding you love show me
from one to a thousand your nights

What is your philosophy of love
you ask me in bed and I respond
It’s not a flower but maybe it is a number Here I gift it to you
Hide it between your legs At the count of two
Make sure that it does not fall One
Open Sesame Two
Loves have stepped into your kingdom

Translated from the Spanish"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""Look she said this is not the distance
we wanted to stay at—We wanted to get
close very close But what
is the way in again And is it

too late She could hear the actions
rushing past—but they are on
another track And in the silence
or whatever it is that follows

there was still the buzzing motes spores
aftereffects and whatnot recalled the morning after
Then the thickness you can’t get past called waiting

Then the you whoever you are peering down to see if it’s
done yet
Then just the look on things being looked-at
Then just the look of things being seen"
Nathalie HandalThe Act of Counting"Death is careless at times It confuses love with a wet afternoon in an empty
room The unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty A
hollow cry  An open mouth falling inside as you sleep  I prepare my heart
and language with better words like worlds in small selves Ive built Every
month one dollar buys me one brick But how many bricks does it take to
build a house A stray dog barks late at night I cant see him but know hes
there  He  reminds  me  that here dreams have dangerous turns I turn
around to no one naked beside me I play it safe not to see the fire in my
hands But let us be clear Im no beggar Its just that there are times when
the world is a sound that cripples the air and the soul When what seems
arranged— glazing and strange like music played on tin cans— turns into
wilting noise When suddenly all that exists is a small boy trying to focus
on the pain lifting a nation A telephone callHe was wearing black shoes a
Calvin Klein T-shirt that he found in a hotel trash brown slacks She was
wearing one earring on her right ear one sock on her left foot a dress the
color of sky She bought him a canne à sucre He pulled her close said Ti
cherie  And after they promised to meet later  she winked and walked
leisurely in the shade A tremble followed When he turned around her body
was one of a thousand on the streets He ran towards her stood by her armunable to see her face The call drops I begin to count the ways I tolerate my
dry mouth To count the glasses of water I gave away to make up for my sins
But this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts"
A E StallingsActaeon"The hounds you know them all by name
You fostered them from purblind whelps
At their dam’s teats and you have come
To know the music of their yelps

High-strung Anthee the brindled bitch
The blue-tick coated Philomel
And freckled Chloe who would fetch
A pretty price if you would sell—

All fleet of foot and swift to scent
Inexorable once on the track
Like angry words you might have meant
But do not mean and can’t take back

There was a time when you would brag
How they would bay and rend apart
The hopeless belling from a stag
You falter now for the foundered hart

Desires you nursed of a winter night—
Did you know then why you bred them—
Whose needling milk-teeth used to bite
The master’s hand that leashed and fed them"
R S ThomasActing"Being unwise enough to have married her
I never knew when she was not acting
‘I love you’ she would say I heard the audiences
Sigh ‘I hate you’ I could never be sure
They were still there She was lovely I
Was only the looking-glass she made up in
I husbanded the rippling meadow
Of her body Their eyes grazed nightly upon it

Alone now on the brittle platform
Of herself she is playing her last rôle
It is perfect Never in all her career
Was she so good And yet the curtain
Has fallen My charmer come out from behind
It to take the applause Look I am clapping too"
Chuang TzuAction and Non-Action"The non-action of the wise man is not inaction
It is not studied It is not shaken by anything
The sage is quiet because he is not moved
Not because he wills to be quiet
Still water is like glass
You can look in it and see the bristles on your chin
It is a perfect level
A carpenter could use it
If water is so clear so level
How much more the spirit of man
The heart of the wise man is tranquil
It is the mirror of heaven and earth
The glass of everything
Emptiness stillness tranquillity tastelessness
Silence non-action this is the level of heaven and earth
This is perfect Tao Wise men find here
Their resting place
Resting they are empty

From emptiness comes the unconditioned
From this the conditioned the individual things
So from the sage’s emptiness stillness arises
From stillness action From action attainment
From their stillness comes their non-action which is also action
And is therefore their attainment
For stillness is joy Joy is free from care
Fruitful in long years
Joy does all things without concern
For emptiness stillness tranquillity tastelessness
Silence and non-action
Are the root of all things"
Todd ColbyAction Town"Right now Im sipping a mango lassi
in Action Town Im not bereft at all In fact
Im pleasantly aware of people moving on all fours
Our voice and text messages will
be erased in no time When I walk into stores
they call me Spark Plug because I have a sparky manner
Things get all wavy from their constant attention
Its going to be okay Im a good habit
you dont need to trick me
Im not sure where I should put my hands
when I walk down the street with you
Its funny to think about who I would
call if something really awful happened
Id be jumping up and down not knowing who to call
My way of doing things is scary even to me
Remember the toothbrush the honey bear
and the meal that we thought would never end
Im counting on you to come through high water
to come through chaos and to Action Town
where well lift our aces to skyward aviation"
Pam RehmActs of Love"If endear is earned
and is meant to identify
two halves

then it composes
one meaning

which means
a token

a knot
a note

a noting in the head
of how it feels

to have your heart
be the dear one"
Pam RehmActs of Vexation"The only thing under the sun
I can run to
is Ecclesiastes

for there is nothing gathered into one self
that can be kept

Want is humbled by death
as every purpose manifests it

Feeling this all my life
a piercing fright
gathers in the stomachs pit

This is it and this is not the end
of the road

for even despair is a kind of goad
to wisdom

The beauty of the world
over ones own anguish

The day that I lost all feeling

I was both a Fool and a Goddess"
John WienersThe Acts of Youth"And with great fear I inhabit the middle of the night
What wrecks of the mind await me what drugs
to dull the senses what little I have left
what more can be taken away

The fear of travelling of the future without hope
or buoy I must get away from this place and see
that there is no fear without me that it is within
unless it be some sudden act or calamity

to land me in the hospital a total wreck without
memory again or worse still behind bars If
I could just get out of the country Some place
where one can eat the lotus in peace

For in this country it is terror poverty awaits or
am I a marked man my life to be a lesson
or experience to those young who would trod
the same path without God

unless he be one of justice to wreak vengeance
on the acts committed while young under un-
due influence or circumstance Oh I have
always seen my life as drama patterned

after those who met with disaster or doom
Is my mind being taken away me
I have been over the abyss before What
is that ringing in my ears that tells me

all is nigh is naught but the roaring of the winter wind
Woe to those homeless who are out on this night
Woe to those crimes committed from which we
can walk away unharmed

So I turn on the light
And smoke rings rise in the air
Do not think of the future there is none
But the formula all great art is made of

Pain and suffering Give me the strength
to bear it to enter those places where the
great animals are caged And we can live
at peace by their side A bride to the burden

that no god imposes but knows we have the means
to sustain its force unto the end of our days
For that is what we are made for for that
we are created Until the dark hours are done

And we rise again in the dawn
Infinite particles of the divine sun now
worshipped in the pitches of the night"
Jean Valentine“Actuarial File”"Orange peels burned letters the car lights shining on the grass
everything goes somewhere—and everything we do—nothing
ever disappears But changes The roar of the sun in photographs
Inching shorelines Ice lines The cells of our skin our meetings
our solitudes Our eyes

A bee careens at the window here flies out released a life
without harm without shame That woman my friend
circling against her life a married life that man my friend
solitary anarchic driving away from home them driving to each
other—

I know the hard half-lost knowing will the cold first loneliness
again outside the commonweal unmoving

But to say
I know
—is there any touch in it

The words in my dream “actuarial file”
Actuary  A registrar or
notary who keeps records of the acts of a court "
Luljeta LleshanakuAcupuncture"Among the personal objects inside a -year-old Chinese tomb
archaeologists found nine acupuncture needles
four gold and five silver
Long before knowing why
ancient doctors knew that pain
must be fought with pain

It’s quite simple an array of needles pricking your arm
for a properly functioning heart and lungs
Needles in the feet to ease insomnia and stress
Needles between your eyes to fight infertility
A little pain here
and the effect is felt elsewhere
Once a group of explorers set out to plant a flag on the South
Pole
a needle at the heel of the globe in the middle of nowhere
But before the mission was completed
a new world war had begun
The impact of the needle was felt in the world’s brain
in the lobe responsible for short-term memory
When Russia used ideology as acupuncture—a needle over the
Urals—
it impacted the pancreas and the control of blood sugar
America paid tenfold for whiskey during Prohibition
and at post offices copies of Joyce’s
“immoral”Ulysses were stored for burning
The universe functions as a single body Stars form lines of
needles
carefully pinned to a broad hairy back
Their impact is felt in the digestive tract each day
a new beginning How can you begin a new day
not having fully absorbed yesterday’s protein
I was a child when my first teacher
mispronounced my last name twice That pricked me
like a needle
A small needle in the earlobe And suddenly
my vision cleared—
I saw poetry
the perfect disguise"
Nicky BeerAd Hominem"The Poet

Fugitive lung prodigal intestine—
where’s the pink crimp in my side
where they took you out


The Octopus

It must be a dull world indeed
where everything appears
to be a version or extrapolation
of you

The birds are you
The springtime is you
Snails hurricanes saddles elevators—
everything becomes
you

I with a shift
of my skin divest my self
to become the rock
that shadows it

Think of when
your reading eyes momentarily drift
and in that instant

you see the maddening swarm of alien ciphers submerged within the text
gone before you can focus
That’s me

Or your dozing revelation
on the subway that you are
slowly being
digested Me again

I am the fever dream
in which you see your loved ones
as executioners I am also their axe

Friend while you’re exhausting
the end of a day
with your sad approximations

I’m a mile deep
in the earth vamping
my most flawless impression
of the abyss
to the wild applause of eels"
Marjorie PickthallAdam and Eve"When the first dark had fallen around them
And the leaves were weary of praise
In the clear silence Beauty found them
And shewed them all her ways

In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds
Beauty before their hearts could harden
Had taught them heavenly words

When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream
Beauty fasted their hands together
And cooled them at her stream

And when day wearied and night grew stronger
And they slept as the beautiful must
Then she bided a little longer
And blossomed from their dust"

"Anne Finch Countess of Winchilsea"Adam Posed"Could our first father at his toilsome plow
Thorns in his path and labor on his brow
Clothed only in a rude unpolished skin
Could he a vain fantastic nymph have seen
In all her airs in all her antic graces
Her various fashions and more various faces
How had it posed that skill which late assigned
Just appellations to each several kind
A right idea of the sight to frame
T’have guessed from what new element she came
T’have hit the wav’ring form or giv’n this thing a name"
William Butler YeatsAdams Curse"We sat together at one summer’s end
That beautiful mild woman your close friend
And you and I and talked of poetry
I said ‘A line will take us hours maybe
Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught
Better go down upon your marrow-bones
And scrub a kitchen pavement or break stones
Like an old pauper in all kinds of weather
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these and yet
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers schoolmasters and clergymen
The martyrs call the world’
And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake
There’s many a one shall find out all heartache
On finding that her voice is sweet and low
Replied ‘To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—
That we must labour to be beautiful’
I said ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing
Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring
There have been lovers who thought love should be
So much compounded of high courtesy
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks
Precedents out of beautiful old books
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough’

We sat grown quiet at the name of love
We saw the last embers of daylight die
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky
A moon worn as if it had been a shell
Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell
About the stars and broke in days and years

I had a thought for no one’s but your ears
That you were beautiful and that I strove
To love you in the old high way of love
That it had all seemed happy and yet we’d grown
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon"
Amanda JerniganAdams Prayer"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
you put this rather beautifully
and gave me leave to sing my work
until my work became the song

In sorrow shalt thou eat of it
a line on which a man might ring
the changes as he tills the ground
from which he was taken Thistle thorn

in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed
these too shall it bring forth to thee
all the days of thy life till the end
the synagogue of the ear of corn

Poem and plowman cleave the dark
One cant eat art But dust is art
and unto dust shall I return
O let my song become my work"

His indifference allowed us to sleep

Cat who made your ears bend back
who made you lazy as quick

Who made you work
It is a wonder any sun is left

Still it is always so abrupt
Sleep like an umbrella going up

clumsy like a broken umbrella coming down
this waking and into what

I did not ask to be afraid
I did not ask for pleasure but there it was

it exfoliated at its own leisure
grew until it was all that was—

The brief interruption of who I am
interrupts and punctuates the day

I always assumed that I would share—
Cat who cut the sun down from the sky

and then responsible put it up again
There must be one of us that you prefer"

A F MoritzAddiction"I wish we could control this revolting
want of control these people
with their spongy eyes their mouths
of trembling shoehorns billhooks for penises
and bear traps for vulvas
One taste of sunlight and at once
they can’t do without it Water
the same and food and air
and a dozen other squalid habits
Some—like their copulation
a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck—
are not physically compulsive but
the partners can’t stop wanting them to be
so we desire to be raped
by love who would fill us they say
with an oil from the lit braziers of stars
What if doing it every day
we resemble pistons and the slow poison
cuts our lives off at 
it’s the grim determination
of our passion And beyond this even I—
defended in childhood by my strong father
the piano and my mother the virtuoso
from knuckles among warehouses—even I
am addicted to the mild light of words"

Obsessed first by one person and then

These Februaries full of draughts and cracks
They belong to the people in the streets the others
Out there – haberdashers writers of menus

Barometers full of contempt controlling moody isobars
Sumptuous tittle-tattle from a summer crowd
That’s fed on lemonades and matinées And seas
That float themselves about from place to place and then

Pattiann Rogers"Address The Archaeans One Cell Creatures""Although most are totally naked
and too scant for even the slightest
color and although they have no voice
that I’ve ever heard for cry or song they are
nevertheless more than mirage more
than hallucination more than falsehood

They have confronted sulfuric
boiling black sea bottoms and stayed
held on under ten tons of polar ice
established themselves in dense salts
and acids survived eating metal ions
They are more committed than oblivion
more prolific than stars

Far too ancient for scripture each
one bears in its one cell one text—
the first whit of alpha the first
jot of bearing beneath the riling
sun the first nourishing of self

Too lavish for saints too trifling
for baptism they have existed
throughout never gaining girth enough
to hold a firm hope of salvation
Too meager in heart for compassion
too lean for tears less in substance
than sacrifice not one has ever
carried a cross anywhere

And not one of their trillions
has ever been given a tombstone
I’ve never noticed a lessening
of light in the ceasing of any one
of them They are more mutable
than mere breathing and vanishing
more mysterious than resurrection
too minimal for death"
Dorothy WordsworthAddress to A Child During A Boisterous Winter Evening"What way does the wind come What way does he go
He rides over the water and over the snow
Through wood and through vale and o’er rocky height
Which the goat cannot climb takes his sounding flight
He tosses about in every bare tree
As if you look up you plainly may see
But how he will come and whither he goes
There’s never a scholar in England knows

He will suddenly stop in a cunning nook
And ring a sharp ’larum but if you should look
There’s nothing to see but a cushion of snow
Round as a pillow and whiter than milk
And softer than if it were covered with silk
Sometimes he’ll hide in the cave of a rock
Then whistle as shrill as the buzzard cock
— Yet seek him and what shall you find in the place
Nothing but silence and empty space
Save in a corner a heap of dry leaves
That he’s left for a bed to beggars or thieves

As soon as ’tis daylight tomorrow with me
You shall go to the orchard and then you will see
That he has been there and made a great rout
And cracked the branches and strewn them about
Heaven grant that he spare but that one upright twig
That looked up at the sky so proud and big
All last summer as well you know
Studded with apples a beautiful show

Hark over the roof he makes a pause
And growls as if he would fix his claws
Right in the slates and with a huge rattle
Drive them down like men in a battle
– But let him range round he does us no harm
We build up the fire we’re snug and warm
Untouched by his breath see the candle shines bright
And burns with a clear and steady light

Books have we to read but that half-stifled knell
Alas ’tis the sound of the eight o’clock bell
— Come now we’ll to bed and when we are there
He may work his own will and what shall we care
He may knock at the door — we’ll not let him in
May drive at the windows — we’ll laugh at his din
Let him seek his own home wherever it be
Here’s a
cozie
warm house for Edward and me"

While scabs and blotches did him gall

Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagallAn Address to the Rev George Gilfillan"All hail to the Rev George Gilfillan of Dundee
He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see
He is a man of genius bright
And in him his congregation does delight
Because they find him to be honest and plain
Affable in temper and seldom known to complain
He preaches in a plain straightforward way
The people flock to hear him night and day
And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away
Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day
He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott
And while he lives he will never be forgot
Nor when he is dead
Because by his admirers it will be often read
And fill their minds with wonder and delight
And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night
He has also written about the Bards of the Bible
Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle
Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main
And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain
And in that he is always right
For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do
Do it with all your might
Rev George Gilfillan of Dundee I must conclude my muse
And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse
Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly that when
You are dead they shall not look upon your like again"
LucretiusAddress to Venus"Delight of Human kind and Gods above
Parent of Rome Propitious Queen of Love
Whose vital pow’r Air Earth and Sea supplies
And breeds what e’r is born beneath the rowling Skies
For every kind by thy prolifique might
Springs and beholds the Regions of the light
Thee Goddess thee the clouds and tempests fear
And at thy pleasing presence disappear
For thee the Land in fragrant Flow’rs is drest
For thee the Ocean smiles and smooths her wavy breast
And Heav’n it self with more serene and purer light is blest
For when the rising Spring adorns the Mead
And a new Scene of Nature stands display’d
When teeming Budds and chearful greens appear
And Western gales unlock the lazy year
The joyous Birds thy welcome first express
Whose native Songs thy genial fire confess
Then savage Beasts bound o’re their slighted food
Strook with thy darts and tempt the raging floud
All Nature is thy Gift Earth Air and Sea
Of all that breathes the various progeny
Stung with delight is goaded on by thee
O’er barren Mountains o’er the flow’ry Plain
The leavy Forest and the liquid Main
Extends thy uncontroul’d and boundless reign
Through all the living Regions dost thou move
And scattr’st where thou goest the kindly seeds of Love
Since then the race of every living thing
Obeys thy pow’r since nothing new can spring
Without thy warmth without thy influence bear
Or beautiful or lovesome can appear
Be thou my ayd My tuneful Song inspire
And kindle with thy own productive fire
While all thy Province Nature I survey
And sing to Memmius an immortal lay
Of Heav’n and Earth and every where thy wond’rous pow’r display
To Memmius under thy sweet influence born
Whom thou with all thy gifts and graces dost adorn
The rather then assist my Muse and me
Infusing Verses worthy him and thee
Mean time on Land and Sea let barb’rous discord cease
And lull the listening world in universal peace
To thee Mankind their soft repose must owe
For thou alone that blessing canst bestow
Because the brutal business of the War
Is manag’d by thy dreadful Servant’s care
Who oft retires from fighting fields to prove
The pleasing pains of thy eternal Love
And panting on thy breast supinely lies
While with thy heavenly form he feeds his famish’d eyes
Sucks in with open lips thy balmy breath
By turns restor’d to life and plung’d in pleasing death
There while thy curling limbs about him move
Involv’d and fetter’d in the links of Love
When wishing all he nothing can deny
Thy charms in that auspicious moment try
With winning eloquence our peace implore
And quiet to the weary World restore"
Frank OHara"Adieu to Norman Bon Jour to Joan and Jean-Paul""It is  in New York and I am wondering
if I will finish this in time to meet Norman for lunch
ah lunch I think I am going crazy
what with my terrible hangover and the weekend coming up
at excitement-prone Kenneth Kochs
I wish I were staying in town and working on my poems
at Joans studio for a new book by Grove Press
which they will probably not print
but it is good to be several floors up in the dead of night
wondering whether you are any good or not
and the only decision you can make is that you did it

yesterday I looked up the rue Frémicourt on a map
and was happy to find it like a bird
flying over Paris et ses environs
which unfortunately did not include Seine-et-Oise
which I dont know
as well as a number of other things
and Allen is back talking about god a lot
and Peter is back not talking very much
and Joe has a cold and is not coming to Kenneths
although he is coming to lunch with Norman
I suspect he is making a distinction
well who isnt

I wish I were reeling around Paris
instead of reeling around New York
I wish I werent reeling at all
it is Spring the ice has melted the Ricard is being poured

we are all happy and young and toothless
it is the same as old age
the only thing to do is simply continue
is that simple
yes it is simple because it is the only thing to do
can you do it
yes you can because it is the only thing to do
blue light over the Bois de Boulogne it continues
the Seine continues
the Louvre stays open it continues it hardly closes at all
the Bar Américain continues to be French
de Gaulle continues to be Algerian as does Camus
Shirley Goldfarb continues to be Shirley Goldfarb
and Jane Hazan continues to be Jane Freilicher I think
and Irving Sandler continues to be the balayeur des artistes
and so do I sometimes I think Im ""in love"" with painting
and surely the Piscine Deligny continues to have water in it
and the Flore continues to have tables and newspapers
and people under them
and surely we shall not continue to be unhappy
we shall be happy
but we shall continue to be ourselves everything
continues to be possible
René Char Pierre Reverdy Samuel Beckett it is possible isnt it
I love Reverdy for saying yes though I dont believe it"
Edward ThomasAdlestrop"Yes I remember Adlestrop—
The name because one afternoon
Of heat the express-train drew up there
Unwontedly It was late June

The steam hissed Someone cleared his throat
No one left and no one came
On the bare platform What I saw
Was Adlestrop—only the name

And willows willow-herb and grass
And meadowsweet and haycocks dry
No whit less still and lonely fair
Than the high cloudlets in the sky

And for that minute a blackbird sang
Close by and round him mistier
Farther and farther all the birds
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire"
Carol V DavisAdmiral Nimitz"Every day in summer Id cross the border
hed nod pick up the horseshoes
hand me one triple the size
of my palm and sayYou first Wed play
away the afternoon Few words
punctuated the clank of horseshoe
against stake until the fog rolled in
and Id retrace my steps home
I was five or six he white haired
however old that meant

One evening my father sat me down
spoke in the exaggerated tone
adults adapt for children asked
if I knew who he was
Admiral Nimitz of course though
I knew nothing of his command
of the Pacific Fleet and was less impressed
than if hed landed a horseshoe

He was a calm man a useful attribute
for sending young men to their deaths
The only time I saw him upset
raccoons had invaded from their hideouts
in the hills attacked the goldfish in his pond
leaving muddy footprints as they escaped
As far as I knew this was his only defeat"
Tod MarshallAdmit Possession to Rent"We stopped at a farmer’s house
before parking at the dock
that creaked over the river
Rowboats for rent five bucks
an hour twenty for the day
Deep water I knew a canvas bag

was in the trunk I knew lunch
would be roast beef sandwiches
and hot stew from a thermos
chunks of carrot and potatoes
cut by my mother who slept
through the racket of our leaving

While my father paid I loaded
the boat with our poles
and tackle boxes lead sinkers
shaped like grey pears raincoats
and a case of beer I was ten
and I knew my dad would toss

that canvas bag into the aluminum
boat with a thunk We fish for gar
with kittens he’d yelled last night
at my mother and that was that
The rowboat slid from the dock
the occasional clunk of the first

six-pack clipped on the fish stringer
and I knew that I should take my time
fastening the wire leader
to the brass swivel tying on
those massive sinkers I knew
that the six-inch treble hook

would tremble in my hands
and when I was done I knew
what came next a canvas bag
stiff kittens blood I tore
two hooks through the side
of a calico yanked upward with a

sharp tug to lodge the third barb
beneath the ribs I dangled
my fingers in cold water
to wash them then reared
the rod back into a cast that splashed
twenty feet from the boat

He popped the third beer and finished
baiting his hook Too deep
for an anchor we drifted
and far beneath the gar cruised
back and forth their prehistoric
snouts slicing the dark bumping

our bait again and again
until that fierce hunger I was learning
said clamp down and take it"
Adrienne SuAdolescence"The trouble was not about finding acceptance
Acceptance was available in the depths of the mind
And among like people The trouble was the look into the canyon
Which had come a long time earlier
And spent many years being forgotten

The fine garments and rows of strong shoes
The pantry stocked with good grains and butter—
Everything could be earned by producing right answers
Answers were important the canyon said
But the answers were not the solution

A glimpse into the future had shown the prairie
On which houses stood sturdily
The earth was moist and generous the sunlight benevolent
The homesteaders dreamed up palaces and descendants
And the animals slept soundly as stones

It was a hard-earned heaven the self-making
Of travelers and often out on the plains
Mirages rose of waterfalls moose and rows of fresh-plowed soil
But nobody stopped to drink the false water
Real water being plentiful they were not thirsty

A few made their fortunes from native beauty
Others from native strength but most from knowledge
As uncertainties in science could be written off to faith
Faith was religious and ordinary life physical
And spiritual was a song that had not yet arrived"
Rita DoveAdolescence-II"Although it is night I sit in the bathroom waiting
Sweat prickles behind my knees the baby-breasts are alert
Venetian blinds slice up the moon the tiles quiver in pale strips

Then they come the three seal men with eyes as round
As dinner plates and eyelashes like sharpened tines
They bring the scent of licorice One sits in the washbowl

One on the bathtub edge one leans against the door
“Can you feel it yet” they whisper
I don’t know what to say again They chuckle

Patting their sleek bodies with their hands
“Well maybe next time” And they rise
Glittering like pools of ink under moonlight

And vanish I clutch at the ragged holes
They leave behind here at the edge of darkness
Night rests like a ball of fur on my tongue"
Percy sshe ShelleyAdonais An Elegy on the Death of John Keats"I

I weep for Adonais—he is dead
Oh weep for Adonais though our tears
Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head
And thou sad Hour selected from all years
To mourn our loss rouse thy obscure compeers
And teach them thine own sorrow say ""With me
Died Adonais till the Future dares
Forget the Past his fate and fame shall be
An echo and a light unto eternity""

II

Where wert thou mighty Mother when he lay
When thy Son lay piercd by the shaft which flies
In darkness where was lorn Urania
When Adonais died With veiled eyes
Mid listening Echoes in her Paradise
She sate while one with soft enamourd breath
Rekindled all the fading melodies
With which like flowers that mock the corse beneath
He had adornd and hid the coming bulk of Death

III

Oh weep for Adonais—he is dead
Wake melancholy Mother wake and weep
Yet wherefore Quench within their burning bed
Thy fiery tears and let thy loud heart keep
Like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep
For he is gone where all things wise and fair
Descend—oh dream not that the amorous Deep
Will yet restore him to the vital air
Death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair

IV

Most musical of mourners weep again
Lament anew Urania He died
Who was the Sire of an immortal strain
Blind old and lonely when his countrys pride
The priest the slave and the liberticide
Trampled and mockd with many a loathed rite
Of lust and blood he went unterrified
Into the gulf of death but his clear Sprite
Yet reigns oer earth the third among the sons of light

V

Most musical of mourners weep anew
Not all to that bright station dard to climb
And happier they their happiness who knew
Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time
In which suns perishd others more sublime
Struck by the envious wrath of man or god
Have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime
And some yet live treading the thorny road
Which leads through toil and hate to Fames serene abode

VI

But now thy youngest dearest one has perishd
The nursling of thy widowhood who grew
Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherishd
And fed with true-love tears instead of dew
Most musical of mourners weep anew
Thy extreme hope the loveliest and the last
The bloom whose petals nippd before they blew
Died on the promise of the fruit is waste
The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast

VII

To that high Capital where kingly Death
Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay
He came and bought with price of purest breath
A grave among the eternal—Come away
Haste while the vault of blue Italian day
Is yet his fitting charnel-roof while still
He lies as if in dewy sleep he lay
Awake him not surely he takes his fill
Of deep and liquid rest forgetful of all ill

VIII

He will awake no more oh never more
Within the twilight chamber spreads apace
The shadow of white Death and at the door
Invisible Corruption waits to trace
His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place
The eternal Hunger sits but pity and awe
Soothe her pale rage nor dares she to deface
So fair a prey till darkness and the law
Of change shall oer his sleep the mortal curtain draw

IX

Oh weep for Adonais The quick Dreams
The passion-winged Ministers of thought
Who were his flocks whom near the living streams
Of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught
The love which was its music wander not—
Wander no more from kindling brain to brain
But droop there whence they sprung and mourn their lot
Round the cold heart where after their sweet pain
They neer will gather strength or find a home again

X

And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head
And fans him with her moonlight wings and cries
""Our love our hope our sorrow is not dead
See on the silken fringe of his faint eyes
Like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies
A tear some Dream has loosend from his brain""
Lost Angel of a ruind Paradise
She knew not twas her own as with no stain
She faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain

XI

One from a lucid urn of starry dew
Washd his light limbs as if embalming them
Another clippd her profuse locks and threw
The wreath upon him like an anadem
Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem
Another in her wilful grief would break
Her bow and winged reeds as if to stem
A greater loss with one which was more weak
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek

XII

Another Splendour on his mouth alit
That mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath
Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit
And pass into the panting heart beneath
With lightning and with music the damp death
Quenchd its caress upon his icy lips
And as a dying meteor stains a wreath
Of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips
It flushd through his pale limbs and passd to its eclipse

XIII

And others came    Desires and Adorations
Winged Persuasions and veild Destinies
Splendours and Glooms and glimmering Incarnations
Of hopes and fears and twilight Phantasies
And Sorrow with her family of Sighs
And Pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam
Of her own dying smile instead of eyes
Came in slow pomp the moving pomp might seem
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream

XIV

All he had lovd and moulded into thought
From shape and hue and odour and sweet sound
Lamented Adonais Morning sought
Her eastern watch-tower and her hair unbound
Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground
Dimmd the aëreal eyes that kindle day
Afar the melancholy thunder moand
Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay
And the wild Winds flew round sobbing in their dismay

XV

Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains
And feeds her grief with his rememberd lay
And will no more reply to winds or fountains
Or amorous birds perchd on the young green spray
Or herdsmans horn or bell at closing day
Since she can mimic not his lips more dear
Than those for whose disdain she pind away
Into a shadow of all sounds a drear
Murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear

XVI

Grief made the young Spring wild and she threw down
Her kindling buds as if she Autumn were
Or they dead leaves since her delight is flown
For whom should she have wakd the sullen year
To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear
Nor to himself Narcissus as to both
Thou Adonais wan they stand and sere
Amid the faint companions of their youth
With dew all turnd to tears odour to sighing ruth

XVII

Thy spirits sister the lorn nightingale
Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain
Not so the eagle who like thee could scale
Heaven and could nourish in the suns domain
Her mighty youth with morning doth complain
Soaring and screaming round her empty nest
As Albion wails for thee the curse of Cain
Light on his head who piercd thy innocent breast
And scard the angel soul that was its earthly guest

XVIII

Ah woe is me Winter is come and gone
But grief returns with the revolving year
The airs and streams renew their joyous tone
The ants the bees the swallows reappear
Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons bier
The amorous birds now pair in every brake
And build their mossy homes in field and brere
And the green lizard and the golden snake
Like unimprisond flames out of their trance awake

XIX

Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean
A quickening life from the Earths heart has burst
As it has ever done with change and motion
From the great morning of the world when first
God dawnd on Chaos in its stream immersd
The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light
All baser things pant with lifes sacred thirst
Diffuse themselves and spend in loves delight
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might

XX

The leprous corpse touchd by this spirit tender
Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath
Like incarnations of the stars when splendour
Is changd to fragrance they illumine death
And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath
Nought we know dies Shall that alone which knows
Be as a sword consumd before the sheath
By sightless lightning—the intense atom glows
A moment then is quenchd in a most cold repose

XXI

Alas that all we lovd of him should be
But for our grief as if it had not been
And grief itself be mortal Woe is me
Whence are we and why are we of what scene
The actors or spectators Great and mean
Meet massd in death who lends what life must borrow
As long as skies are blue and fields are green
Evening must usher night night urge the morrow
Month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow

XXII

He will awake no more oh never more
""Wake thou"" cried Misery ""childless Mother rise
Out of thy sleep and slake in thy hearts core
A wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs""
And all the Dreams that watchd Uranias eyes
And all the Echoes whom their sisters song
Had held in holy silence cried ""Arise""
Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung

XXIII

She rose like an autumnal Night that springs
Out of the East and follows wild and drear
The golden Day which on eternal wings
Even as a ghost abandoning a bier
Had left the Earth a corpse Sorrow and fear
So struck so rousd so rapt Urania
So saddend round her like an atmosphere
Of stormy mist so swept her on her way
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay

XXIV

Out of her secret Paradise she sped
Through camps and cities rough with stone and steel
And human hearts which to her aery tread
Yielding not wounded the invisible
Palms of her tender feet whereer they fell
And barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they
Rent the soft Form they never could repel
Whose sacred blood like the young tears of May
Pavd with eternal flowers that undeserving way

XXV

In the death-chamber for a moment Death
Shamd by the presence of that living Might
Blushd to annihilation and the breath
Revisited those lips and Lifes pale light
Flashd through those limbs so late her dear delight
""Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless
As silent lightning leaves the starless night
Leave me not"" cried Urania her distress
Rousd Death Death rose and smild and met her vain caress

XXVI

""Stay yet awhile speak to me once again
Kiss me so long but as a kiss may live
And in my heartless breast and burning brain
That word that kiss shall all thoughts else survive
With food of saddest memory kept alive
Now thou art dead as if it were a part
Of thee my Adonais I would give
All that I am to be as thou now art
But I am chaind to Time and cannot thence depart

XXVII

""O gentle child beautiful as thou wert
Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men
Too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart
Dare the unpasturd dragon in his den
Defenceless as thou wert oh where was then
Wisdom the mirrord shield or scorn the spear
Or hadst thou waited the full cycle when
Thy spirit should have filld its crescent sphere
The monsters of lifes waste had fled from thee like deer

XXVIII

""The herded wolves bold only to pursue
The obscene ravens clamorous oer the dead
The vultures to the conquerors banner true
Who feed where Desolation first has fed
And whose wings rain contagion how they fled
When like Apollo from his golden bow
The Pythian of the age one arrow sped
And smild The spoilers tempt no second blow
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low

XXIX

""The sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn
He sets and each ephemeral insect then
Is gatherd into death without a dawn
And the immortal stars awake again
So is it in the world of living men
A godlike mind soars forth in its delight
Making earth bare and veiling heaven and when
It sinks the swarms that dimmd or shard its light
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirits awful night""

XXX

Thus ceasd she and the mountain shepherds came
Their garlands sere their magic mantles rent
The Pilgrim of Eternity whose fame
Over his living head like Heaven is bent
An early but enduring monument
Came veiling all the lightnings of his song
In sorrow from her wilds Ierne sent
The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue

XXXI

Midst others of less note came one frail Form
A phantom among men companionless
As the last cloud of an expiring storm
Whose thunder is its knell he as I guess
Had gazd on Natures naked loveliness
Actaeon-like and now he fled astray
With feeble steps oer the worlds wilderness
And his own thoughts along that rugged way
Pursud like raging hounds their father and their prey

XXXII

A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift—
A Love in desolation maskd—a Power
Girt round with weakness—it can scarce uplift
The weight of the superincumbent hour
It is a dying lamp a falling shower
A breaking billow even whilst we speak
Is it not broken On the withering flower
The killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek
The life can burn in blood even while the heart may break

XXXIII

His head was bound with pansies overblown
And faded violets white and pied and blue
And a light spear toppd with a cypress cone
Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew
Yet dripping with the forests noonday dew
Vibrated as the ever-beating heart
Shook the weak hand that graspd it of that crew
He came the last neglected and apart
A herd-abandond deer struck by the hunters dart

XXXIV

All stood aloof and at his partial moan
Smild through their tears well knew that gentle band
Who in anothers fate now wept his own
As in the accents of an unknown land
He sung new sorrow sad Urania scannd
The Strangers mien and murmurd ""Who art thou""
He answerd not but with a sudden hand
Made bare his branded and ensanguind brow
Which was like Cains or Christs—oh that it should be so

XXXV

What softer voice is hushd over the dead
Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown
What form leans sadly oer the white death-bed
In mockery of monumental stone
The heavy heart heaving without a moan
If it be He who gentlest of the wise
Taught soothd lovd honourd the departed one
Let me not vex with inharmonious sighs
The silence of that hearts accepted sacrifice

XXXVI

Our Adonais has drunk poison—oh
What deaf and viperous murderer could crown
Lifes early cup with such a draught of woe
The nameless worm would now itself disown
It felt yet could escape the magic tone
Whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong
But what was howling in one breast alone
Silent with expectation of the song
Whose masters hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung

XXXVII

Live thou whose infamy is not thy fame
Live fear no heavier chastisement from me
Thou noteless blot on a rememberd name
But be thyself and know thyself to be
And ever at thy season be thou free
To spill the venom when thy fangs oerflow
Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee
Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now

XXXVIII

Nor let us weep that our delight is fled
Far from these carrion kites that scream below
He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead
Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now
Dust to the dust but the pure spirit shall flow
Back to the burning fountain whence it came
A portion of the Eternal which must glow
Through time and change unquenchably the same
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame

XXXIX

Peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep
He hath awakend from the dream of life
Tis we who lost in stormy visions keep
With phantoms an unprofitable strife
And in mad trance strike with our spirits knife
Invulnerable nothingsWe decay
Like corpses in a charnel fear and grief
Convulse us and consume us day by day
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay

XL

He has outsoard the shadow of our night
Envy and calumny and hate and pain
And that unrest which men miscall delight
Can touch him not and torture not again
From the contagion of the worlds slow stain
He is secure and now can never mourn
A heart grown cold a head grown gray in vain
Nor when the spirits self has ceasd to burn
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn

XLI

He lives he wakes—tis Death is dead not he
Mourn not for Adonais Thou young Dawn
Turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee
The spirit thou lamentest is not gone
Ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan
Cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou Air
Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown
Oer the abandond Earth now leave it bare
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair

XLII

He is made one with Nature there is heard
His voice in all her music from the moan
Of thunder to the song of nights sweet bird
He is a presence to be felt and known
In darkness and in light from herb and stone
Spreading itself whereer that Power may move
Which has withdrawn his being to its own
Which wields the world with never-wearied love
Sustains it from beneath and kindles it above

XLIII

He is a portion of the loveliness
Which once he made more lovely he doth bear
His part while the one Spirits plastic stress
Sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there
All new successions to the forms they wear
Torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight
To its own likeness as each mass may bear
And bursting in its beauty and its might
From trees and beasts and men into the Heavens light

XLIV

The splendours of the firmament of time
May be eclipsd but are extinguishd not
Like stars to their appointed height they climb
And death is a low mist which cannot blot
The brightness it may veil When lofty thought
Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair
And love and life contend in it for what
Shall be its earthly doom the dead live there
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air

XLV

The inheritors of unfulfilld renown
Rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought
Far in the Unapparent Chatterton
Rose pale his solemn agony had not
Yet faded from him Sidney as he fought
And as he fell and as he livd and lovd
Sublimely mild a Spirit without spot
Arose and Lucan by his death approvd
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprovd

XLVI

And many more whose names on Earth are dark
But whose transmitted effluence cannot die
So long as fire outlives the parent spark
Rose robd in dazzling immortality
""Thou art become as one of us"" they cry
""It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long
Swung blind in unascended majesty
Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song
Assume thy winged throne thou Vesper of our throng""

XLVII

Who mourns for Adonais Oh come forth
Fond wretch and know thyself and him aright
Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth
As from a centre dart thy spirits light
Beyond all worlds until its spacious might
Satiate the void circumference then shrink
Even to a point within our day and night
And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink
When hope has kindled hope and lurd thee to the brink

XLVIII

Or go to Rome which is the sepulchre
Oh not of him but of our joy tis nought
That ages empires and religions there
Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought
For such as he can lend—they borrow not
Glory from those who made the world their prey
And he is gatherd to the kings of thought
Who wagd contention with their times decay
And of the past are all that cannot pass away

XLIX

Go thou to Rome—at once the Paradise
The grave the city and the wilderness
And where its wrecks like shatterd mountains rise
And flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress
The bones of Desolations nakedness
Pass till the spirit of the spot shall lead
Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
Where like an infants smile over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread

L

And gray walls moulder round on which dull Time
Feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand
And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime
Pavilioning the dust of him who plannd
This refuge for his memory doth stand
Like flame transformd to marble and beneath
A field is spread on which a newer band
Have pitchd in Heavens smile their camp of death
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguishd breath

LI

Here pause these graves are all too young as yet
To have outgrown the sorrow which consignd
Its charge to each and if the seal is set
Here on one fountain of a mourning mind
Break it not thou too surely shalt thou find
Thine own well full if thou returnest home
Of tears and gall From the worlds bitter wind
Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb
What Adonais is why fear we to become

LII

The One remains the many change and pass
Heavens light forever shines Earths shadows fly
Life like a dome of many-colourd glass
Stains the white radiance of Eternity
Until Death tramples it to fragments—Die
If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek
Follow where all is fled—Romes azure sky
Flowers ruins statues music words are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak

LIII

Why linger why turn back why shrink my Heart
Thy hopes are gone before from all things here
They have departed thou shouldst now depart
A light is passd from the revolving year
And man and woman and what still is dear
Attracts to crush repels to make thee wither
The soft sky smiles the low wind whispers near
Tis Adonais calls oh hasten thither
No more let Life divide what Death can join together

LIV

That Light whose smile kindles the Universe
That Beauty in which all things work and move
That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse
Of birth can quench not that sustaining Love
Which through the web of being blindly wove
By man and beast and earth and air and sea
Burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of
The fire for which all thirst now beams on me
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality

LV

The breath whose might I have invokd in song
Descends on me my spirits bark is driven
Far from the shore far from the trembling throng
Whose sails were never to the tempest given
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven
I am borne darkly fearfully afar
Whilst burning through the inmost veil of Heaven
The soul of Adonais like a star
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are"
Joyelle McSweeney"Adriaen het Kint
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""Adriaen het Kint dead prisoner
passes back through the eye of the needle
into the wombed-shaped anatomy theater
in a caul of umbra mortis lo
Tho I pass through the valley of the shadow
of death I wear a caul stitched by the needle
through which a camel passed like the condom
passed through the drug mule sperm
through the pierced condom a camera
through a heart Just as
the face of every Dutchman
is lit by a flashbulb conceived
two hundred years in the future
Adriaen het Kint now lifts a flayed hand
to demonstrate
how to put the god back together
once he’s been dismembered
and scattered among the reeds
Adriaen het Kint
shall we gather at the river
to scoop up the disjecta membra How
with flayed hand
shall we pluck the white lyre
that rides the black thorax
of the zika mosquito
resplendent in her viral robes
She is a messenger to all nations as she
lowers her improbable proboscis
into the human layer
and vomits an inky toxin
from the Greek
for arrow ink
for arrow an arrow that
sinks its bleat into the alien chordata
so that the future contracts
into itself slinks off slips
further down the drain sinks
further down the wall
outside the clinic
the infected needle
blocking the stoma
of the future
with a crusty pus
The sleeper juts
a canine up
through the gum
without meaning to
and an answering moon
orbiting Jupiter
winks back
a salt signature
betrays a vein of water
asleep beneath the frozen strata
whereunto a white-clad
nurse or rover soon will sink
a toothed cannula
to draw it off
How complete
ly she circumvents
the eye of the needle
how completely she bypasses
that camel-route
to Heaven as she
drains away
for human use
the plasma and the data"
Ray GonzalezAdult"Everything was the apple and the glass of tea
The mountain the mold the apron on the grandmother—
the neck of a brown baby holding its tiny head
to get rid of the black bees
This is the end of a bad century
the opening of a door that was never built into the chest

A volume of loud wires coming out of the ground
My grandfather rising from fifty-four years of death to see me
The instrument carved out of bone
A lock of hair from a famous seventeenth-century poet
The disintegrating bible wishing it was another book
A hanging arm sweeping the water out of the way
My memory of flying through the tunnel that came out of nowhere

A dog with wings and a cat with magic
The sentiment and the sweat
The blue chest of the working man and
the bare ankle of a young girl who drank beer
The shadow of a young boy named Carlos and
the bare shoulders of a young girl who whispered

The hunger of an older boy named José
The hard work of a brother named Ramón with
a closeness and a disagreement among them
A torn pair of work pants and
a stiff and muddy pair of gloves
A pocket with two dollars crumbled inside
A bare foot rubbing the bare back of a young girl
The fourth can of beer
The farmhouse that belonged to the family
and the chickens that were killed for food
The cactus garden that killed two men when they fell in
and the pieces of green cactus that made them dream
The green juice that started the earthquake
the crushed flesh of cactus on their tongues
and its swelling that made them dream
A garden hose washing away the blood
The sparrow hovering over the trash can and
the back alley stinking of dog shit and drunken men
Falling feathers interpreted for what they bring

A church next door full of sermons and howling black faces
The corner of the house where a young boy went to hide
A single strand of hair found in a high school yearbook
the forgotten idea that hiding it in there would lead to a different life
The piano wounded by stones falling out of the cottonwood
The willow tree spreading over the entire front yard
and the tiny white balls of gum that fell out of it one day

The smell of shadows trains humor tumbleweeds
ice empty parking lots one or two torn knees
a baseball glove the first guy to cross the finish line
the fear the dread and the skill of escaping
so no one would start a list of smells

Fear melted the memory of a lost boy
The old house the rosary around the neck
the crushed dog in the road—
a sudden calling from behind to warn him
to come in and be still
Who recalls how this ended when the men
built their ships and invaded to change the outcome

The right to cry out and wait a whole century
The embers the lone piano the oil lamps
damaged by a dream
The ambition in the spine
Who will insist on tapping the window to show
how easy it is to delay the next hundred years"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""In the damp sick
In the dough
In the chewed on chew of faces
of expensive car owner faces
chewed ons of the world
I do not fetishize the truth
I poke around
Holding my bland sandwich
in my non-dominant hand I think
what could be worse I think
what could be as bad

To feel the thing you want
to feel and not to care

To be a wet road

Fanny HoweThe Advance of the Father"From raindrenched Homeland into a well the upturned animal
was mine by law and outside the tunnel him again
Everywhere I turned the children ran between “Loose dogs”
he roared I remember one sequence a gulf in his thinking
meant swim as fast as you can But it was winter and the water
was closed The mouths of the children were sealed with ice
After all we were swimming in emotion not water

“Shut up you Father” I shouted over my shoulder Racing
but not spent my mind went “It isn’t good that the human being
is all I have to go by  It isn’t good that I know who I love
but not who I trust  It isn’t good that I can run to a priest
but not to a plane  I lost my way exactly like this”

Inverted tunnel of the self
Throat or genital search for the self
Light that goes on in the self when the eyes are shut
Uniformity impossible in the psyche’s pre-self
like a day never spent or how the unseen can make itself felt

It was as if a boy was calling from the end of a long island
Docks were vertical and warlike
I would be on one side of my bed like a mother who can tell
she’s a comfort because she’s called Mother
Still we both would be able to see the edge of the problem

It’s true that the person is also a thing
When you are running you know the texture I was clawing
at the palm of one hand and brushing up my blues with the other
A man who wore his boxers at night remarked that my daughter
was tired He had nothing to do with anything

Ahead was the one with magnified eyes and historical data to last
Know-how and the hysteria to accomplish his whole life
It was horrible what we would do for peace
We told him the story of the suffering he made us feel
with the ingratiating stoop of those who came second in the world"
Tom SleighThe Advance"


Out the barred window sandbags
in a sagging wall surround the guard post
where a soldier half-hidden by the flag
holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost

It’s Sunday and quiet the traffic noise
off aways the sea behind the post flat as the tarps
pulled tight over the troop trucks
Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys

telling some joke in Arabic
in which I’m pretty sure I hear the word “zubrak”
I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations

the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room
while a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares
If you sleep in a cemeteryyou’re bound to have nightmares





No one sees the doll’s decapitated head small
and neat in rubble Never tired or sleepy
the head is its own country
obstinately surviving the pupil

of   its one eye peering through the glass’s pure
transparency And a few feet away lie its slim plastic
long-legged thighs almost like
an obscenity the eye watches over —

no one in the street nothing but bolt-marks
from tank-treads scarring the concrete
to give any of   it drama — and what

about the way the lips’ frozen smirk
keeps daring me to touch the sexless V
between the thighs staring up at me





The barracks dissolve into a reef   of   rubble in the fog
On either side of the road crater after crater
flashes with glints of glass plastic bags
a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair

The TV station the power stacks
thrusting up through mist the black-bearded posters
and banners strung across
the streets lead to an absolute nowhere

all that’s left in the emptied town
after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets
fluttering up around the car that winds

down the coast road deeper into mist headlights
probing like instruments in a wound
they illuminate the more they violate"

Michael MetivierAdvection Blues"The mower alone
saw from the median
the cloud come over
the mountain down to trawl
the valley like a whale
and the swifts like water
passing through her white baleen

The mower alone patrolling
the haw with the hawks
saw from the median
the cloud come over
the mountain to swallow
where the sky had been
and where the town had been
pinned by steeples
and hummed electric hubris

For everyone else
on either side of the narrow
the cloud was only a minute
of a single verse

Mary Jo SalterAdvent"Wind whistling as it does
in winter and I think
nothing of it until

it snaps a shutter off
her bedroom window spins
it over the roof and down

to crash on the deck in back
like something out of Oz
We look up stunned—then glad

to be safe and have a story
characters in a fable
we only half-believe

Look in my surprise
I somehow split a wall
the last one in the house

we’re making of gingerbread
We’ll have to improvise
prop the two halves forward

like an open double door
and with a tube of icing
cement them to the floor

Five days until Christmas
and the house cannot be closed
When she peers into the cold

interior we’ve exposed
she half-expects to find
three magi in the manger

a mother and her child
She half-expects to read
on tablets of gingerbread

a line or two of Scripture
as she has every morning
inside a dated shutter

on her Advent calendar
She takes it from the mantel
and coaxes one fingertip

under the perforation
as if her future hinges
on not tearing off the flap

under which a thumbnail picture
by Raphael or Giorgione
Hans Memling or David

of apses niches archways
cradles a smaller scene
of a mother and her child

of the lidded jewel-box
of Mary’s downcast eyes
Flee into Egypt cries

the angel of the Lord
to Joseph in a dream
for Herod will seek the young


child to destroy him While
she works to tile the roof
with shingled peppermints

I wash my sugared hands
and step out to the deck
to lug the shutter in

a page torn from a book
still blank for the two of us
a mother and her child"
Donald HallAdvent"When I see the cradle rocking
What is it that I see
I see a rood on the hilltop
Of Calvary

When I hear the cattle lowing
What is it that they say
They say that shadows feasted
At Tenebrae

When I know that the grave is empty
Absence eviscerates me
And I dwell in a cavernous constant"
Gjertrud SchnackenbergAdvent Calendar"Bethlehem in Germany
Glitter on the sloping roofs
Breadcrumbs on the windowsills
Candles in the Christmas trees
Hearths with pairs of empty shoes
Panels of Nativity
Open paper scenes where doors
Open into other scenes
Some recounted some foretold
Blizzard-sprinkled flakes of gold
Gleam from small interiors
Picture-boxes in the stars
Open up like cupboard doors
In a cabinet Jesus built

Southern German villagers
Peasants in the mica frost
See the comet streaming down
Heavenly faces each alone
Faces lifted startled lost
As if lightning lit the town

Sitting in an upstairs window
Patiently the village scholar
Raises his nearsighted face
Interrupted by the star
Left and right his hands lie stricken
Useless on his heavy book
When I lift the paper door
In the ceiling of his study
One canary-angel glimmers
Flitting in the candelabra
Peers and quizzes him Rabbi
What are the spheres surmounted by
But his lips are motionless
Child what are you asking for
Look he gazes past the roofs
Gazes where the bitter North
Stretched across the empty place
Opens door by door by door

This is childhoods shrunken door
When I touch the glittering crumbs
When I cry to be admitted
No one answers no one comes

And the tailors needle flashes
In midair with thread pulled tight
Stitching a baptismal gown
But the gown the seventh door
Turns up an interior
Hidden from the tailors eyes
Baby presents like the boxes
Angels hold on streets and stairways
Wooden soldier wooden sword
Chocolate coins in crinkled gold
Hints of something bought and sold
Hints of murder in the stars
Babys gown is sown with glitter
Spread across the tailors lap
Up above his painted ceiling
Baby mouses skeleton
Crumbles in the mouses trap

Leaning from the cliff of heaven
Indicating whom he weeps for
Joseph lifts his lamp above
The infant like a candle-crown
Let my fingers touch the silence
Where the infants father cries
Give me entrance to the village
From my childhood where the doorways
Open pictures in the skies
But when all the doors are open
No one sees that Ive returned
When I cry to be admitted
No one answers no one comes
Clinging to my fingers only
Pain like glitter bits adhering
When I touch the shining crumbs"
Scott Cairns"Adventures in New Testament Greek
  
   Nous""You could almost think the word synonymous
with mind given our so far narrow
history and the excessive esteem

in which we have been led to hold what is
in this case our rightly designated
nervous systems Little wonder then

that some presume the mind itself both part
and parcel of the person the very seat
of soul and lately crucible for a host

of chemical incentives—combinations
of which can pretty much answer for most
of our habits and for our affections

When even the handy lexicon cannot
quite place the nous as anything beyond
one rustic ancestor of reason you might

be satisfied to trouble the odd term
no further—and so would fail to find
your way to it most fruitful faculty

untried Dormant in its roaring cave
the heart’s intellective aptitude grows dim
unless you find a way to wake it So

let’s try something even now Even as
you tend these lines attend for a moment
to your breath as you draw it in regard

the breath’s cool descent a stream from mouth
to throat to the furnace of the heart
Observe that queer cool confluence of breath

and blood and do your thinking there"
Russell EdsonThe Adventures of a Turtle"The turtle carries his house on his back He is both the house and the person of that house
But actually under the shell is a little room where the true turtle wearing long underwear sits at a little table At one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor like the controls of a steam shovel It is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house
Most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns He leans on one elbow and then the other He crosses one leg and then the other Finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps
If he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape
If he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits He knows that children are careless and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place where he will relight his candle take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns Then he’ll bury his head in his arms and sleepThat is until another child picks up his house"
Wisława SzymborskaAdvertisement"I’m a tranquilizer
I’m effective at home
I work in the office
I can take exams
on the witness stand
I mend broken cups with care
All you have to do is take me
let me melt beneath your tongue
just gulp me
with a glass of water

I know how to handle misfortune
how to take bad news
I can minimize injustice
lighten up God’s absence
or pick the widow’s veil that suits your face
What are you waiting for—
have faith in my chemical compassion

You’re still a young man/woman
It’s not too late to learn how to unwind
Who said
you have to take it on the chin

Let me have your abyss
I’ll cushion it with sleep
You’ll thank me for giving you
four paws to fall on

Sell me your soul
There are no other takers

There is no other devil anymore"
Dan GerberAdvice"You know how after it rains
my father told me one August afternoon
when I struggled with something
hurtful my best friend had said
how worms come out and
crawl all over the sidewalk
and it stays a big mess
a long time after it’s over
if you step on them

Leave them alone
he went on to say
after clearing his throat
and when the rain stops
they crawl back into the ground"
Michael Earl CraigAdvice for Horsemen"When trying to catch a horse it helps if you look away
Eye contact just pisses them off
But you can’t fake looking away horses
know when you are doing this
You have to really look away
Some horsemen never come out of  this"
Deborah A MirandaAdvice from La Llorona"—a found poem

Each grief has its unique side
Choose the one that appeals to you
Go gently
Your body needs energy to repair the amputation
Humor phantom pain

Your brain cells are soaked with salt
connections fail unexpectedly and often
Ask for help
Accept help

Read your grief like the daily newspaper
headlines may have information you need
Scream Drop-kick the garbage can across the street

Don’t feel guilty if you have a good time
Don’t act as if you haven’t been hit by a Mack Truck
Do things a little differently
but don’t make a lot of changes
Revel in contradiction

Talk to the person who died
Give her a piece of your mind

Try to touch someone at least once a day
Approach grief with determination
Pretend the finish line doesn’t keep receding
Lean into the pain
You can’t outrun it"
Stephanie BurtAdvice from Rock Creek Park"What will survive us
has already begun

Oak galls
Two termites’ curious
self-perpetuating bodies

Letting the light through the gaps

They lay out their allegiances
under the roots
of an overturned tree

Almost always better
to build than to wreck

You can build in a wreck

Under the roots
of an overturned tree

Consider the martin that hefts
herself over traffic cones

Consider her shadow
misaligned
over parking-lot cement
Saran Wrap scrap in her beak

Nothing lasts
forever not even
the future we want

The President has never
owned the rain"
Susan Elizabeth HoweAdvice from the Grackle"the seven songs
After joy raises you into the stratosphere
ride earth’s colors as you wheel down

Fear backs you into a cave
only then do you cackle and hiss

Curse at a tornado and it might curse back

Why kick pebbles on your enemy
You will die without burying him

The ascent out of despair
must be steady slow or your lungs
will explode your blood boil

Which is wisest to endure hunger
or waddle among wolves

Warn those you love when the predator
approaches Screech loudest when you
are the predator"
Stephanie BurtAdvice from the Lights"If you dont get too close to people you cant disappoint them
which would be so much worse
than letting them disappoint you

To the extent that you gain
a perch that means other people look up to you
to just that extent you can never
tell them how you feel

You can warble or
follow a siren or a Shenandoah
vireo into the shade or take
advice from the lights be
a child or be like a child
You will want for nothing and you will never be heard"
Richard Wilbur"Advice to a Prophet
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""When you come as you soon must to the streets of our city
Mad-eyed from stating the obvious
Not proclaiming our fall but begging us
In God’s name to have self-pity

Spare us all word of the weapons their force and range
The long numbers that rocket the mind
Our slow unreckoning hearts will be left behind
Unable to fear what is too strange

Nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race
How should we dream of this place without us—
The sun mere fire the leaves untroubled about us
A stone look on the stone’s face

Speak of the world’s own change Though we cannot conceive
Of an undreamt thing we know to our cost
How the dreamt cloud crumbles the vines are blackened by frost
How the view alters We could believe

If you told us so that the white-tailed deer will slip
Into perfect shade grown perfectly shy
The lark avoid the reaches of our eye
The jack-pine lose its knuckled grip

On the cold ledge and every torrent burn
As Xanthus once its gliding trout
Stunned in a twinkling What should we be without
The dolphin’s arc the dove’s return

These things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken
Ask us prophet how we shall call
Our natures forth when that live tongue is all
Dispelled that glass obscured or broken

In which we have said the rose of our love and the clean
Horse of our courage in which beheld
The singing locust of the soul unshelled
And all we mean or wish to mean

Ask us ask us whether with the worldless rose
Our hearts shall fail us come demanding
Whether there shall be lofty or long standing
When the bronze annals of the oak-tree close"
Thomas MertonAdvice to a Young Prophet"Keep away son these lakes are salt These flowers
Eat insects Here private lunatics
Yell and skip in a very dry country

Or where some haywire monument
Some badfaced daddy of fear
Commands an unintelligent rite

To dance on the unlucky mountain
To dance they go and shake the sin
Out of their feet and hands

Frenzied until the sudden night
Falls very quiet and magic sin
Creeps secret back again

Badlands echo with omens of ruin
Seven are very satisfied regaining possession
Bring a little mescaline you’ll get along

There’s something in your bones
There’s someone dirty in your critical skin
There’s a tradition in your cruel misdirected finger
Which you must obey and scribble in the hot sand

“Let everybody come and attend
Where lights and airs are fixed
To teach and entertain O watch the sandy people
Hopping in the naked bull’s-eye

Shake the wildness out of their limbs
Try to make peace like John in skins
Elijah in the timid air
or Anthony in tombs

Pluck the imaginary trigger brothers
Shoot the devil he’ll be back again”

America needs these fatal friends
Of God and country to grovel in mystical ashes
Pretty big prophets whose words don’t burn
Fighting the strenuous imago all day long

Only these lunatics O happy chance
Only these are sent Only this anaemic thunder
Grumbles on the salt flats in rainless night

O go home brother go home
The devil’s back again
And magic Hell is swallowing flies"
Jonathan SwiftAdvice to the Grub Street Verse-writers"Ye poets ragged and forlorn
Down from your garrets haste
Ye rhymers dead as soon as born
Not yet consignd to paste

I know a trick to make you thrive
O tis a quaint device
Your still-born poems shall revive
And scorn to wrap up spice

Get all your verses printed fair
Then let them well be dried
And Curll must have a special care
To leave the margin wide

Lend these to paper-sparing Pope
And when he sets to write
No letter with an envelope
Could give him more delight

When Pope has filld the margins round
Why then recall your loan
Sell them to Curll for fifty pound
And swear they are your own"
Robert BurnsAe Fond Kiss"Ae fond kiss and then we sever
Ae fareweel and then forever
Deep in heart-wrung tearsIll pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee
Who shall say that Fortune grieves him
While the star of hope she leaves him
Me nae cheerfu twinkle lights me
Dark despair around benights me

Ill neer blame my partial fancy
Naething could resist my Nancy
But to see her was to love her
Love but her and love forever
Had we never lovd sae kindly
Had we never lovd sae blindly
Never met—or never parted—
We had neer been broken-hearted

Fare thee weel thou first and fairest
Fare thee weel thou best and dearest
Thine be ilka joy and treasure
Peace enjoyment love and pleasure
Ae fond kiss and then we sever
Ae fareweel alas forever
Deep in heart-wrung tearsIll pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee"

Virgil"Aeneid
  
   II  - end""As he spoke we could hear ever more loudly the noise
Of the burning fires the flood of flames was coming
Nearer and nearer “My father let me take you
Upon my shoulders and carry you with me
The burden will be easy Whatever happens
You and I will experience it together
Peril or safety whichever it will be
Little Iülus will come along beside me
My wife will follow behind us And you my servants
Listen to what I say just as you leave
The limits of the city there is a mound
And the vestiges of a deserted temple of Ceres
And a cypress tree that has been preserved alive
For many years by the piety of our fathers
We will all meet there though perhaps by different ways
And Father you must carry in your arms
The holy images of our household gods
I coming so late from the fighting and the carnage
Cannot presume to touch them until I have washed
Myself in running water” Thus I spoke

I take up the tawny pelt of a lion and
Cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it
And bowing down I accept the weight of my father
Iülus puts his hand in mine and goes
Along beside me trying to match my steps
As best he can trying his best to keep up
My wife follows behind us a little way back
So we all set out together making our way
Among the shadows and I who only just
A little while ago had faced undaunted
Showers of arrows and swarms of enemy Greeks
Am frightened by every slightest change in the air
And startled by every slightest sound I hear
Fearful for whom I walk with and whom I carry
And just as I had almost come to the gates
And thought that I had almost gotten us free
I thought I heard the sound of many feet
And my father peering intently into the shadows
Cries out to me “Get away get away my son
My son they are coming I see their shining shields
I see the glow of their weapons in the dark”
I am alarmed and I don’t know what happened
But some power hostile to me distracts my wits
And I am confused and I lead us away by ways
That I don’t know and off the familiar streets
That together we are following and so
O God some fate has taken away my wife
Creüsa my wife away from me What happened
Did she wander from the way that we were going
Did she fall back having to rest some place
Back there and so we left her I did not know
I never saw her again and as we went
I never turned to look behind and never
Thought of her until we reached the mound
And Ceres’ ancient place When all of us
At last had gotten there we all were there
But she had vanished and she wasn’t there
Gone from her people gone from her child and her husband

What men or gods in my frenzy did I not
Cry out against What worse sight had I seen
I left Ascanius and Anchises and
The household gods in the care of my companions
And I found a secluded place deep in a valley
For them to hide and I myself took up
My shining weapons and sought the city again
Determined no matter what to look for my
Creüsa everywhere in Troy I find
My way along the walls and to and through
The shadowed gate I’d left the city by
Carefully step by unseen step in the dark
Backwards the way I came I make my way
Everywhere as I go fills me with terror
The very silence around me fills me with terror
I make my way to my home in case in case
She’s gone back there The Greeks had invaded the house
And set it on fire and through the house the fire
Rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof
And the flames tower high above the burning house
And the heat of the burning pours up into the sky
And so I go on and once again I see
The palace of Priam and the citadel
And in the empty courtyard of Juno’s shrine
There’s Phoenix and dire Ulysses guarding the treasures
Taken from everywhere from the shrines that the Greeks
Had set fire to the golden bowls the holy
Altar-tables the stolen holy vestments
Boys and trembling matrons stand around   
I wander in the streets in my desperation
Calling out her name Creüsa Creüsa
Calling Creüsa over and over again
And as I went among the ruined buildings
And through the streets of the ruined city lo
Suddenly there rose before my eyes
The strangely magnified image of my wife
I was stupefied my hair stood on end my voice
Got caught in my throat Then she spoke to me and said
Words that altered everything for me
“Beloved husband what use is it for you
To persist in this insanity of grief
What has happened here has happened not without
The will of the gods The high lord of Olympus
Does not permit Creüsa to go with you
To be with you on your journey where you are going
Long exile will be yours ploughing across
Vast seas until you come to Hesperia
Where Lydian Tiber gently flows between
Rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy
A king and wedded to a royal wife
Give up your weeping now for your Creüsa
I a Dardan woman and the spouse
Of divine Venus’s son will never see
The scornful households of the Myrmidons
Or the Dolopians and never have to be
A scullion slave in service to some Greek matron
The Mighty Mother keeps me on these shores
Farewell and may your care protect and cherish
Your child and mine” And having spoken thus
The image of her receded into air
Leaving me weeping with so much still to say
Three times I tried to embrace her and to hold her
Three times the image clasped in vain escaped
As if it were a breeze or on the wings
Of a vanishing dream
And so the night being over
I returned to my companions where they were
When I got there I was amazed to see
How many others women and men had come
Wretched survivors of the fall of the city
To join us in the exile and the journey
A heartbreaking company come from everywhere
Ready in their hearts and with their fortunes
To follow me wherever I was going
And now the morning star was rising over
The highest ridges of Ida bringing in
The day that was beginning the Danaans held
The city behind the gates that they had locked
There was no hope of further help And so
I acknowledged this and taking up the burden
Of my father once again I sought the hills"
Jean FollainAesomes"The snecks aye sweirt and ayont
a doverin cratur wi a lit o the lowe

Amaud Jamaul JohnsonAesthetics"we must know a force
greater than our weaknesses

—Jean Toomer

like most boys ignorant
or fearful of beauty we
pinned back the wings

of butterflies and plucked
off their legs and watched
and watched them tumble

from leaves like pinecones
wheeling from rooftops
and we laughed

we crumbled alka-seltzer
for the pigeons “those
flying rats” my mother’s

ex-husband once called
their bodies floundering like
toys flung from a window

white foam from their mouths
stark against the asphalt
framing their artless convulsions

and we laughed
with open-mouths until
tears dripped from our

chins and our throats
were raw with the rightness
of god"
Constance UrdangAesthetics of the Asylum"The sober reality
Was a double line of orphans in blue smocks
Marching above the blue river
Under the smoky eye of winter
It is possible to envy them
The picture of which they formed a part
Was so well composed
In shades of blue and smoke
And the dull brick red of the asylum walls
How orderly and tranquil the effect
Of the wintry ranks of children
Under the silent sky"
David BakerThe Affair"

Then the long fencerow that years ago had
heaved and buckled took on a copper shine
in the sunset the dew A garlic haze
of cut pastures simmered fields away




They were flushed from sex—they were
traced with that other body just parted
They stood in the length of first fall waiting
And their skin that had been so willing




delible as ash to a trembling fingertip
became its own again One star three
Nothing good was going to happen Night winds
lifted themselves out of wheat rows and shook




off what had been done So they turned
elsewhere Her fingers gathered up her collar
softly in a bunch and she put on a scarf
It was not even cold It was only cool"
Cesare PaveseAffairs"Dawn on the black hill and up on the roof
cats drowsing Last night there was a boy
who fell off this roof breaking his back
The wind riffles the cool leaves of the trees
The red clouds above are warm and move slowly
A stray dog appears in the alley below sniffing
the boy on the cobblestones and a raw wail
rises up among chimneys someone’s unhappy

The crickets were singing all night and the stars
were blown out by the wind In dawn’s glow
even the eyes of the cats in love were extinguished
the cats the boy watched The female is crying
no toms are around and nothing can soothe her
not the tops of the trees not the red clouds
She cries to the wide sky as if it were still night

The boy was spying on cats making love
The stray dog sniffs the boy’s body and growls
he got here at dawn fleeing the glow
that crept down the far hill Swimming the river
that drenched him as dew drenches fields
he was finally caught by the light The bitches
were still howling
The river runs smoothly
skimmed by birds that drop from red clouds
elated to find their river deserted"

Militarily Has To Dominate Three Quarter of The World"
Anna WickhamThe Affinity"I have to thank God Im a woman
For in these ordered days a woman only
Is free to be very hungry very lonely

It is sad for Feminism but still clear
That man more often than woman is pioneer
If I would confide a new thought
First to a man must it be brought

Now for our sins it is my bitter fate
That such a man wills soon to be my mate
And so of friendship is quick end
When I have gained a love I lose a friend

It is well within the order of things
That man should listen when his mate sings
But the true male never yet walked
Who liked to listen when his mate talked

I would be married to a full man
As would all women since the world began
But from a wealth of living I have proved
I must be silent if I would be loved

Now of my silence I have much wealth
I have to do my thinking all by stealth
My thoughts may never see the day
My mind is like a catacomb where early Christians pray

And of my silence I have much pain
But of these pangs I have great gain
For I must take to drugs or drink
Or I must write the things I think

If my sex would let me speak
I would be very lazy and most weak
I should speak only and the things I spoke
Would fill the air awhile and clear like smoke

The things I think now I write down
And some day I will show them to the Town
When I am sad I make thought clear
I can re-read it all next year

I have to thank God Im a woman
For in these ordered days a woman only
Is free to be very hungry very lonely"
George HerbertThe Affliction I"When first thou didst entice to thee my heart
I thought the service brave
So many joys I writ down for my part
Besides what I might have
Out of my stock of natural delights
Augmented with thy gracious benefits

I looked on thy furniture so fine
And made it fine to me
Thy glorious household-stuff did me entwine
And tice me unto thee
Such stars I counted mine both heavn and earth
Paid me my wages in a world of mirth

What pleasures could I want whose King I servd
Where joys my fellows were
Thus argud into hopes my thoughts reservd
No place for grief or fear
Therefore my sudden soul caught at the place
And made her youth and fierceness seek thy face

At first thou gavst me milk and sweetnesses
I had my wish and way
My days were strawd with flowrs and happiness
There was no month but May
But with my years sorrow did twist and grow
And made a party unawares for woe

My flesh began unto my soul in pain
""Sicknesses cleave my bones
Consuming agues dwell in evry vein
And tune my breath to groans""
Sorrow was all my soul I scarce believd
Till grief did tell me roundly that I livd

When I got health thou tookst away my life
And more for my friends die
My mirth and edge was lost a blunted knife
Was of more use than I
Thus thin and lean without a fence or friend
I was blown through with evry storm and wind

Whereas my birth and spirit rather took
The way that takes the town
Thou didst betray me to a lingring book
And wrap me in a gown
I was entangled in the world of strife
Before I had the power to change my life

Yet for I threatend oft the siege to raise
Not simpring all mine age
Thou often didst with academic praise
Melt and dissolve my rage
I took thy sweetned pill till I came where
I could not go away nor persevere

Yet lest perchance I should too happy be
In my unhappiness
Turning my purge to food thou throwest me
Into more sicknesses
Thus doth thy power cross-bias me not making
Thine own gift good yet me from my ways taking

Now I am here what thou wilt do with me
None of my books will show
I read and sigh and wish I were a tree
For sure then I should grow
To fruit or shade at least some bird would trust
Her household to me and I should be just

Yet though thou troublest me I must be meek
In weakness must be stout
Well I will change the service and go seek
Some other master out
Ah my dear God though I am clean forgot
Let me not love thee if I love thee not"
Robert BridgesThe Affliction of Richard"Love not too much But how
When thou hast made me such
And dost thy gifts bestow
How can I love too much
Though I must fear to lose
And drown my joy in care
With all its thorns I choose
The path of love and prayer

Though thou I know not why
Didst kill my childish trust
That breach with toil did I
Repair because I must
And spite of frighting schemes
With which the fiends of Hell
Blaspheme thee in my dreams
So far I have hoped well

But what the heavenly key
What marvel in me wrought
Shall quite exculpate thee
I have no shadow of thought
What am I that complain
The love from which began
My question sad and vain
Justifies thee to man"
Yusef KomunyakaaThe African Burial Ground"They came as Congo Guinea amp Angola
feet tuned to rhythms of a thumb piano
They came to work fields of barley amp flax

livestock stone amp slab brick amp mortar
to make wooden barrels some going
from slave to servant amp half-freeman

They built tongue amp groove— wedged
into their place in New Amsterdam
Decades of seasons changed the city

from Dutch to York amp dream-footed
hard work rattled their bones
They danced Ashanti They lived

amp died Shrouded in cloth in cedar
amp pine coffins Trinity Church
owned them in six amp a half acres

of sloping soil Before speculators
arrived grass amp weeds overtook
what was most easily forgotten

amp tannery shops drained there
Did descendants amp newcomers
shoulder rock amp heave loose gravel

into the landfill before building crews
came their guitars amp harmonicas
chasing away ghosts at lunch break

Soon footsteps of lower Manhattan
strutted overhead back amp forth
between old denials amp new arrivals

going from major to minor pieties
always on the go The click of heels
the tap of a drum awaking the dead"
Robert DuncanAn African Elegy"In the groves of Africa from their natural wonder
the wildebeest zebra the okapi the elephant
have enterd the marvelous No greater marvelous
know I than the mind’s
natural jungle The wives of the Congo
distil there their red and the husbands
hunt lion with spear and paint Death-spore
on their shields wear his teeth claws and hair
on ordinary occasions There the Swahili
open his doors let loose thru the trees
the tides of Death’s sound and distil
from their leaves the terrible red He
is the consort of dreams I have seen heard
in the orchestral dark
like the barking of dogs

Death is the dog-headed man zebra striped
and surrounded by silence who walks like a lion
who is black It was his voice crying come back
that Virginia Woolf heard turnd
her fine skull hounded and haunted stopt
pointed into the scent where
I see her in willows in fog at the river of sound
in the trees I see her prepare there
to enter Death’s mountains
like a white Afghan hound pass into the forest
closed after let loose in the leaves
with more grace than a hound and more wonder there
even with flowers wound in her hair allowing herself
like Ophelia a last
pastoral gesture of love toward the world
And I see
all our tortures absolved in the fog
dispersed in Death’s forests forgotten I see
all this gentleness like a hound in the water
float upward and outward beyond my dark hand

I am waiting this winter for the more complete black-out
for the negro armies in the eucalyptus for the cities
laid open and the cold in the love-light for hounds
women and birds to go back to their forests and leave us
our solitude




Negroes negroes all those princes
holding cups of rhinoceros bone make
magic with my blood Where beautiful Marijuana
towers taller than the eucalyptus turns
within the lips of night and falls
falls downward where as giant Kings we gathered
and devourd her burning hands and feet O Moonbar
thee and Clarinet those talismans
that quickened in their sheltering leaves like thieves
those Negroes all those princes
holding to their mouths like Death
the cups of rhino bone
were there to burn my hands and feet
divine the limit of the bone and with their magic
tie and twist me like a rope I know
no other continent of Africa more dark than this
dark continent of my breast

And when we are deserted there
when the rustling electric has passt thru the air
once more we begin in the blind and blood throat
the African catches and Desdemona Desdemona
like a demon wails within our bodies warns
against this towering Moor of self and then
laments her passing from him

And I cry Hear
Hear in the coild and secretive ear
the drums that I hear beat The Negroes all those princes
holding cups of bone and horn are there in halls
of blood that I call forests in the dark
and shining caverns where
beats heart and pulses brain in
jungles of my body there
Othello moves striped black and white
the dog-faced fear Moves I I I
whom I have seen as black as Orpheus
pursued deliriously his sound and drownd
in hunger’s tone the deepest wilderness

Then it was I Death singing
who bewildered the forest I thot him
my lover like a hound of great purity
disturbing the shadow and flesh of the jungle
This was the beginning of the ending year
From all of the empty the tortured appear
and the bird-faced children crawl out of their fathers
and into that never filld pocket
the no longer asking but silent seeing nowhere
the final sleep

The halls of Africa we seek in dreams
as barriers of dream against the deep and seas
disturbd turn back upon their tides
into the rooms deserted at the roots of love
There is no end And how sad then
is even the Congo How the tired sirens
come up from the water not to be toucht
but to lie on the rocks of the thunder
How sad then is even the marvelous"

   Launch Audio in a New Window"After Lauren Halsey and Mike Demps
Fady JoudahAfter"Over treasure and land some texts will say it had
Little to do with slavery or the newly
Discovered yellow planet

Few men watched the glaciers recede
From shuttles they had built
During the hemorrhage years
When they’d gathered all the genes down from the ledges

I’ll be a fig or a sycamore tree
Or without hands

By then doctors and poets
Would have found a cure for prayer


•


Or have you shoved the door shut
In the face of the dark

Have you body and light the trap
Of retribution doing unto you

What it does to others You protest
In the streets and papers and I leave

For a faraway land
Where with pill and scalpel

And a distant reckoning
If he should lick his lips

Or clench his fist I shall find his second left toe
Infected puffy

From a bump
I’ll lance it and squeeze

Out the pus and offer
Him an antibiotic

I can’t refuse therefore I am

The first time I saw you it was hot I was fed up
The second time your wife gave birth to a macerated boy

I had nothing to tell you
About letting go of the dying
In the morning you were gone

Had carried your father back to your house
His cracked skull
I didn’t know that was your wife
When I raised my voice

To those who were praying
From behind the wall to keep it down

I was trying to listen to your baby’s heartbeat
With a gadget a century old

•


Anemic
From so much loss giving birth

If you give blood in the desert you won’t
Get it back not your iron pills or magic hat
I put your thin
Hemoglobin up to the light and called out

To the donors Donors
If you want to know your blood type
And it’s a match
You must donate

Few came some indifferent to my condition
Not having heard of it
And willing anyhow

•


And the world is south
The night a bandit with gasoline

And I’m your dancing lizard mirth
I put my one arm up
And bring my one foot down on a hot zinc top
The nearest hospital was the dawn

She didn’t know her daughter on her back was
The entry wound and she the exit

She ran a brothel so
The officer said

Where the rebels came and went
And ran into the government boys

Her girl’s femur the size of the bullet

•


He was from the other side rumors
Had a bullet through his left arm
Or had it bitten off by a camel

A camel elephant of the desert never forgets what you are
If you aren’t kind to it

When I met him his bladder was the size
Of a watermelon his prostate a cantaloupe
You cannot catheterize
A man forever

Every hour on the hour his left arm stump
Hanging his good arm holding
His penis his buttocks in deep squeeze
A charge from the rear without spillage

This poor murderous thief desperately single-
Handedly began slapping his own ass
As if he were dashing a stallion in a raid
On some unarmed village

•


The mind in the field
The brine in the field

Whether I
Is a diphthong codependent on

What isn’t there to stay in the field
The good you act is equal

To the good you doubt
Most have lost many

You are either prosperous
Or veteran in the field

•


A mother offers not necessarily
Sells her one-eyed son

For an education if you’ll bring him back
And stone dust for one
With congenital illness

And little boy with malaria
Same old gas

Money mixed with blood
Transfusion the doctor’s perfect record broken

Nobility of taking
A life you

Who must walk to and from your house
The jeep’s upkeep
The donkey-cart ambulance

•


One boot left behind

The one-boot photo I wanted
On a book military black the quad a clinic’s

Special Forces spun
By his dangling heels from

The pickup truck rushed
To a central town altered combative

With two scalp lacerations and blood
In his auditory canal

I was a lover of loss I tossed
The boot in the capital of suffering"
Jenny BrowneAfter a God"The man I love most says one day
he will take a ballpoint pen and connect
the stars across this freckled
scoop of chest and milky way
We’ll cross the slope
of pale belly and name
the new constellation after a god
who shows people
all the places they might shine"
A E StallingsAfter a Greek Proverb"Ουδέν μονιμότερον του προσωρινού
We’re here for the time being I answer to the query—
Just for a couple of years we said a dozen years back
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary

We dine sitting on folding chairs—they were cheap but cheery
We’ve taped the broken window pane
tv
’s still out of whack
We’re here for the time being I answer to the query

When we crossed the water we only brought what we could carry
But there are always boxes that you never do unpack
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary

Sometimes when I’m feeling weepy you propose a theory
Nostalgia and tear gas have the same acrid smack
We’re here for the time being I answer to the query—

We stash bones in the closet when we don’t have time to bury
Stuff receipts in envelopes file papers in a stack
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary

Twelve years now and we’re still eating off the ordinary
We left our wedding china behind afraid that it might crack
We’re here for the time being we answer to the query
But nothing is more permanent than the temporary"
Robert WrigleyAfter a Rainstorm"Because I have come to the fence at night
the horses arrive also from their ancient stable
They let me stroke their long faces and I note
in the light of the now-merging moon

how they a Morgan and a Quarter have been
by shake-guttered raindrops
spotted around their rumps and thus made
Appaloosas the ancestral horses of this place

Maybe because it is night they are nervous
or maybe because they too sense
what they have become they seem
to be waiting for me to say something

to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here
that they might awaken from this strange dream
in which there are fences and stables and a man
who doesn’t know a single word they understand"
Tom PickardAfter a row"A lapwing somersaults spring
flips over winter and back

After a fast walk up long hills my limbs
the engine of  thought where burn
bubbles into beck and clough to gill
beneath a sandstone cliff  balanced on a bed of shale
and held from hurtling by Scots pine
that brush a scrubby sky with cloud snow scutters
I found a place to sit
by snapping watta smacking rocks
and wondered — how would it be for you

And so alone
un-alone even in my anger
bring you here"
Elena Karina rne"After a While You Win Death Pastoral""Someone else’s child not you is running and running
down the beach Both feet dig into the burning sand
Two others heave one yellow bucket full of sugar-brown
seaweed their twin suits flowering

a conflation of pink over blue behind the water So
landmark cactus and landmine rock battlefield uphill toward
the early moon’s white horse head and each wave collapses to your
right unsettles shouting every half minutehave me shhhh
have me shhhh halve me shhhh"
Mai Der Vang"After All Have Gone
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""I once carried my mollusk tune
All the way to the lottery of gods

Rain was the old funeral choir
That keened of a hemisphere

Moored under lampwings
Clouds never left I knew

The lights would shine clearer
If I closed my eyes just as

I knew the Pacific would teach
Me to sleep before tying my

Name to the flaming Here I
Am now at the end of amethyst

Drizzling another lost sunrise
Inside the quilt of your hand"
Robert FrostAfter Apple-Picking"My long two-pointed ladders sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still
And theres a barrel that I didnt fill
Beside it and there may be two or three
Apples I didnt pick upon some bough
But I am done with apple-picking now
Essence of winter sleep is on the night
The scent of apples I am drowsing off
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass
It melted and I let it fall and break
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take
Magnified apples appear and disappear
Stem end and blossom end
And every fleck of russet showing clear
My instep arch not only keeps the ache
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
The rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch
Cherish in hand lift down and not let fall
For all
That struck the earth
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine whatever sleep it is
Were he not gone
The woodchuck could say whether its like his
Long sleep as I describe its coming on
Or just some human sleep"
William E StaffordAfter Arguing against the Contention That Art Must Come from Discontent"Whispering to each handhold “Ill be back”
I go up the cliff in the dark One place
I loosen a rock and listen a long time
till it hits faint in the gulf but the rush
of the torrent almost drowns it out and the wind—
I almost forgot the wind it tears at your side
or it waits and then buffets you sag outward   

I remember they said it would be hard I scramble
by luck into a little pocket out of
the wind and begin to beat on the stones
with my scratched numb hands rocking back and forth
in silent laughter there in the dark—
“Made it again” Oh how I love this climb
—the whispering to stones the drag the weight
as your muscles crack and ease on working
right They are back there discontent
waiting to be driven forth I pound
on the earth riding the earth past the stars
“Made it again Made it again”"
Bernadette MayerAfter Catullus and Horace"only the manners of centuries ago can teach me
how to address you my lover as who you are
O Sestius how could you put up with my children
thinking all the while you were bearing me as in your mirror
it doesnt matter anymore if spring wreaks its fiery
or lamblike dawn on my new-found asceticism some joke
I wouldnt sleep with you or any man if you paid me
and most of you poets dont have the cash anyway
so please rejoin your fraternal books forever
while you miss in your securest sleep Ms Rosy-fingered dawn
who mightve been induced to digitalize a part of you
were it not for your self-induced revenge of undoneness
its good to live without a refrigerator why bother
to chill the handiwork of Ceres and of Demeter
and of the lonesome Sappho lets have it warm for now"
Christina RossettiAfter Death"The curtains were half drawn the floor was swept
And strewn with rushes rosemary and may
Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay
Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept
He leaned above me thinking that I slept
And could not hear him but I heard him say
‘Poor child poor child’ and as he turned away
Came a deep silence and I knew he wept
He did not touch the shroud or raise the fold
That hid my face or take my hand in his
Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head
He did not love me living but once dead
He pitied me and very sweet it is
To know he still is warm though I am cold"
Mark JarmanAfter Disappointment"To lie in your child’s bed when she is gone
Is calming as anything I know To fall
Asleep her books arranged above your head
Is to admit that you have never been
So tired so enchanted by the spell
Of your grown body To feel small instead
Of blocking out the light to feel alone
Not knowing what you should or shouldn’t feel
Is to find out no matter what you’ve said
About the cramped escapes and obstacles
You plan and face and have to call the world
That there remain these places occupied
By children yours if lucky like the girl
Who finds you here and lies down by your side"
Rachel WetzsteonAfter Eden"Somewhere Zeno was smiling the foul
goblins of paradox were wearing
their fairest clothes that night My Dinner
with a Chainsaw the evening could have
been called and when one too many led
to wise judgements too few “I’m trying
to break up with you” he shouted as
stockings and scruples flew and what was
over wasn’t the brutal doings
were sweeter than a caress the thrill
of it happening and the horror
of it being an awful mistake
collided like sweaty bodies in
the dark disheveled room So this is
moving on she reflected after
he left But what was motion No straight
bright line but a wind every bit as
stormy as the people it carried
away from safety through towns that froze
and burned helping them forward but not
letting them forget for a second
their ceaseless looking for what is lost
their sad resemblance to the quick and
stubborn arrows that never arrive"
W D Snodgrass"“After Experience Taught Me ”
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""After experience taught me that all the ordinary
Surroundings of social life are futile and vain

I’m going to show you something very
Ugly someday it might save your life

Seeing that none of the things I feared contain
In themselves anything either good or bad

What if you get caught without a knife
Nothing—even a loop of piano wire

Excepting only in the effect they had
Upon my mind I resolved to inquire

Take the first two fingers of this hand
Fork them out—kind of a “V for Victory”—

Whether there might be something whose discovery
Would grant me supreme unending happiness

And jam them into the eyes of your enemy
You have to do this hard Very hard Then press

No virtue can be thought to have priority
Over this endeavor to preserve one’s being

Both fingers down around the cheekbone
And setting your foot high into the chest

No man can desire to act rightly to be blessed
To live rightly without simultaneously

You must call up every strength you own
And you can rip off the whole facial mask

Wishing to be to act to live He must ask
First in other words to actually exist


And you whiner who wastes your time
Dawdling over the remorseless earth
What evil what unspeakable crime
Have you made your life worth"
William FaulknerAfter Fifty Years"Her house is empty and her heart is old
And filled with shades and echoes that deceive
No one save her for still she tries to weave
With blind bent fingers nets that cannot hold
Once all men’s arms rose up to her ‘tis told
And hovered like white birds for her caress
A crown she could have had to bind each tress
Of hair and her sweet arms the Witches’ Gold

Her mirrors know her witnesses for there
She rose in dreams from other dreams that lent
Her softness as she stood crowned with soft hair
And with his bound heart and his young eyes bent
And blind he feels her presence like shed scent
Holding him body and life within its snare"
Chelsea RathburnAfter Filing for Divorce"Your paperwork in it’s like the morning after
a party the shaken survey of damage
a waste of bottles where there was laughter
It all seems so much more than you can manage
the accusing cups and stubbed-out cigarettes
the sun assaulting the window your throbbing head
It’s not enough to face your own regrets
though they’re coming back fast the things you said
because someone’s trailed bean dip across the table
someone’s ground salsa in the rug with his shoe
So you start to clean as much as you are able
and think how far those hours have fled from you
before the hangover and your sour tongue
when you felt lovely and infinite and young"
Robert CreeleyAfter Frost"He comes here
by whatever way he can
not too late
not too soon

He sits waiting
He doesn’t know
why he should
have such a patience

He sits at a table
on a chair
He is comfortable
sitting there

No one else
in this room
no others no expectations
no sounds

Had he walked
another way
would he be here
like they say"
Ivor GurneyAfter-Glow"To F W Harvey
Out of the smoke and dust of the little room
With tea-talk loud and laughter of happy boys
I passed into the dusk Suddenly the noise
Ceased with a shock left me alone in the gloom
To wonder at the miracle hanging high
Tangled in twigs the silver crescent clear
Time passed from mind Time died and then we were
Once more at home together you and I

The elms with arms of love wrapped us in shade
Who watched the ecstatic west with one desire
One soul uprapt and still another fire
Consumed us and our joy yet greater made
That Bach should sing for us mix us in one
The joy of firelight and the sunken sun"
Justice AmeerAfter God Herself"Adam ate an apple
it got stuck in his throat
and they called him Eve
the progenitor
the creator of all things
the mother of strength
and fortitude
and sadness
Adam ate an apple
choked on it so hard
a rib popped out of his chest
and they called it Eve
the progenitor
the creator of all things
the mother of strength and fortitude
and sadness
it takes the hacking of a body
to make a woman
Adam hacking up a piece of his body
it was just a piece of fruit
they called me fruit once too
they called me fruity
before they called me flaming
before they called me faggot
before they called me woman
i thought i would have
to hack this body into pieces
woman a name stuck in my throat
right under the apple Adam tried to eat
choked on it for years
waited for my ribs to pop out
my chest to explode
for my Eve to be created
from the fruit i couldn’t swallow
they called me fruit once
until they called me woman
and then they just called me fruitless
as if it took a womb to be
progenitor
creator
mother of all things
strength and fortitude and sadness
they reckon God looked
at the image of herself
and called it Adam
they still don’t call me woman
they still don’t birth me Eve
even though they cast me out
my throat shrunken close
with the fruit still stuck in it
like Adam
before they called him Eve
and suddenly i am a stranger
to Eden
i am a stranger to this body
as if it hadn’t always been mine
i reckon God looked
at the image of herself
and called it me
but i don’t know if that
was before or after the apple
before or after Adam choked
which came first
the progenitor or the mother
the apple or the rib
the strength or the sadness
this body was God’s original creation
but they called it sin
they called it Adam
I reckon God looked
at the image of  herself
and called Adam Eve
after she choked on his name
some fruit that bloomed
in everyone else’s throat
but she could never quite swallow
the fall of man was an apple
hacked up from a fruitless body
a woman learning what evil was
like a man forcing his name upon you
the fall of man was a rib
being torn from a chest
and men calling that violence holy
naming a woman based only
on the body parts she’s made of
the fall of man
was the beginning of Eve
Eve casting out Adam’s name
Eve discovering who she was
the progenitor
the creator of all things
the mother of strength
and fortitude
and sadness
the fall of man
was Eve becoming a woman
with or without Eden’s approval
and now
every time someone
tries to call her Adam
tries to force the apple
of his name down her throat
she laughs
she swallows
she looks at God herself
and she smiles"
Emily Dickinson"After great pain a formal feeling comes – ""After great pain a formal feeling comes –
The Nerves sit ceremonious like Tombs –
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He that bore’
And ‘Yesterday or Centuries before’

The Feet mechanical go round –
A Wooden way
Of Ground or Air or Ought –
Regardless grown
A Quartz contentment like a stone –

This is the Hour of Lead –
Remembered if outlived
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow –
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –"
Margaret HasseAfter His Diagnosis"Weeks after ice-out
last fall’s leaves
make a pathway
to the lake radiant blue
and still deathly cold

I press my hot forehead
to the window
smudging it Blow
and the glass steams
As if looking at a photo
through parchment
I’m detached
the way I saw his body
in the CAT scan
from a foggy distance

I’d like to open the window
release a wounded bird
nursed to health
Wiping the glass
with my sleeve
I see white pelicans
wheel and flash in the sky"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""When one thing is becoming another when writing is morphing when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing typewriters even a nib and ink well and considering all the ways of stretching a space digital or hard copy hard copy an ugly expression for printed matter and for that matter printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty Page a soft and elongated word page an extension at the end of my fingers page a screen that holds dreams and desires the page of legal document that bind The page is a promise I read all sides turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what I may have missed
Desire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid The pen is a body an anatomy not an earthworm with indecipherable ends the pen has a head and tail and inky guts And the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks

Bodies resume their boundaries

These legs for instance mine
Your arms take you back in

Spoons of our fingers lips

or play loud music
or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman
and Fergus will only sink deeper
into his dreamless sleep which goes by all in one flash
but let there be that heavy breathing
or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house
and he will wrench himself awake
and make for it on the run—as now we lie together
after making love quiet touching along the length of our bodies
familiar touch of the long-married
and he appears—in his baseball pajamas it happens
the neck opening so small he has to screw them on—
and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep
his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child

In the half darkness we look at each other
and smile
and touch arms across this little startlingly muscled body—
this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making
sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake
this blessing love gives again into our arms"
Deborah Slicer"After Metaphysics or When the Fly Leaves the Flybottle""Just when I’m ready to call in the day and put it to bed without supper
you send the mockingbird who plays with his musical zipper
exposing the World’s underlife
You send purfume from the autumn olive
whose septillion flowering ears are full of bees
singing songs for the revolution
Out back Jake’s Creek is speaking in tongues—
Missed you-missed you-missed you

You wear me down obsessively
rubbing your hands along my better judgment
kissing the upturned noses of all my higher principles until
my clothes are big as a mast sail
until my longing leavens one thousand wedding cakes
my longing is an undertow and all the tourist beaches are postedDanger

Come for me—I’ll break off my arms and will them to a body
of water hang my legs up in overalls at night
so they won’t come after us feed
English to the birds in sweet pats of butter

Then our loving gets raucous—
white moths yapping their wings—you wag you
wag in the little fingerbowl of me

Your verbstem assumes declensions of mythic proportions
My vowel sounds open on the south-most hallelujah side of the mountain
Then metaphysically speaking we’ve stopped speaking
metaphorically—Silence

Louis SimpsonAfter Midnight"The dark streets are deserted
With only a drugstore glowing
Softly like a sleeping body

With one white naked bulb
In the back that shines
On suicides and abortions

I might live here myself

The garage man returns
And puts the change in my hand
Counting the singles carefully"
Ailbhe DarcyAfter my son was born"I’d a snip cut in his tongue
Blood scissored down his chin
At every squall I’d been unsnibbing
myself and starving him He knocked
me so my nose coughed blood
punched a finger through my cornea
Blood blubbed on my nipple
where his gums met On the radio
somebody was saying something about Syria
My son jerked knots of hair from my head
tears dashed off his fontanelle He’d fixed
my hips so my clothes didn’t fit I blundered
him once against the doorjamb
blood I’d bit his father
when we were younger drinking harder
made blood come then Twice I tried to leave
him screaming twenty minutes at a time
but couldn’t keep schtum
One breakfast I broke the mug that insisted
“Don’t Mess With Texas”
Smashed it And all the time
I smiled so much my teeth dried
He made everything heavy
Like they say the bomb did for a while
so that Americans swam
through their homes eyes peeled
picking up everyday things and dropping them
as though they were violated with light and pain
As though blood hadn’t always been there waiting"

bob that never changed as if a piece
of bronze had been chiseled onto her

could prove it was a wig but we knew it was
too perfect to be real Then you came in-
to my home—but not the way someone
came in one afternoon while we were away
grocery shopping leaving the side door wide
open releasing my white-winged parakeet
my mother’s jewelry and our television
gone And for years I watched you go
from analog into digital you were
the modicum of motherhood I encountered
daily while my mother stood on a production
line mouthing prayers for prosperity
and health in a room of air
compressors You’re a super galactic
hologram—scattered light reconstructed
through the dark matter ever-shrinking
pixels—shifting the cosmology
of the world with gigs of Gayle and
revolutionary road trips And now

will find you Your last broadcast

Dennis Cooper"After School Street Football Eighth Grade""Their jeans sparkled cut off
way above the knee and my
friends and I would watch them
from my porch books of poems
lost in our laps eyes wide as
tropical fish behind our glasses

Their football flashed from hand
to hand tennis shoes gripped
the asphalt sweats spotlight on
their strong backs We would
dream of hugging them and crouch
later in weird rooms and come

Once their ball fell our way
so two of them came over hands
on their hips asking us to
throw it to them which Arthur did
badly and they chased it back
One turned to yell “Thanks”

and we dreamed of his long
teeth in our necks We
wanted them to wander over
place deep wet underarms to
our lips and then their white
asses then those loud mouths

One day one guy was very tired
didnt move fast enough
so a car hit him and he sprawled
fifty feet away sexy but he was
dead blood like lipstick then
those great boys stood together

on the sidewalk and we joined them
mixing in like one big friendship
to the cops who asked if we were
and those boys were too sad to counter
Wed known his name Tim and how
hed turned to thank us nicely

but now he was under a sheet
anonymous as God the big boys crying
spitting words and we stunned
like intellectuals get our high
voices soft as the tinkling of a
chandelier on a ceiling too high to see"

his face comes into focus
He’s stolen something
from me amp I don’t know
if it has a name or not—
like counting your ribs
with one foolish hand
amp mine with the other"
Primus St JohnAfter That"Every story has its lean meat
and its solid church
so he started to rape her for years
However owls close their eyes
in the daytime
because they’re awake all night
and she waited for him
at the handle of his hunting knife
the bells ringing afterward
with the kind of lust
she’s always known
After that her flights were silent
and her voice of rats and mice
I don’t understand sorcery or omens
even eyes as penetrating as hers
but under her feathers
and all along the tips of her flight
where she’s let me touch her
I’ve kissed her fright"
Fiona Sampson"After the Air Tattoo
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""All in the stilly night the muntjac
roars from its hedge a barking roar
of July heat its own broken-open
fruition
under black
viscose a sky
static with plane-roar

The intermission after the greatest air show in the world
fields and lane recovering
tarmac tonguing sky again
languid
in the summer half-dark towards Fairford

where ancient glass trembles
facets of dark open to tumble out
king revenge-tragedy triumphal colors of God"
Alice Fulton"After the Angelectomy
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""And where my organ of veneration should be—
wormwood and gall Grudge sliver

Wailbone iron bitters I mean to say the miniature
waterfalls have all dried up in this miniature

place where day is duty cubed time is time on task
and every mind optimized for compliance

Time to delint my black denim traveling stuff
The flourescent major highlighter has dimmed

to minor Im so dying I wrote
when I meant to write so tired

And when I sleep I dream only that
Im sleeping Please see my black stuffs

dusted off Night has no dilution anxieties
but only the infinites are happy

Math Time Everything happy goes
to many decimal places

while flesh passes through
gradations of glory I visualized it

the nurse said of the bedsore Everything exists
at the courtesy of everything else

Please see that my grave is kept clean
Beloveds finite things

in which the infinite endangered itself
excarnate to memory and the divine substance

has limited liability Youre kind
I tell the infinite Too kind"
Aimee Nezhukumatathil"After the Auction I Bid You Good-Bye""You elbow me with your corduroy jacket
when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up
I can’t hear your whispers above the auctioneer’s racket

The clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked
me up when you impersonated him in bed Like a wild thick mop
I soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket

In two days I will drive you to the airport packed
with other couples pressed tightly at the top
of the escalator Lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket

when we hug—then a quick kiss good-bye tacked
on at the end I’ll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup
you leave in my car When I hear your name I can’t forget

how your long torso pressed against my bare back
bluish in this early light Your fingers shot into me popped
my spine into a wicked arch There is no lack

of how it haunts me still—what I bid—lost sacked
and wrapped for other girls I should have looked up
to see who else was bidding but I studied the folds in your jacket
My limit is spent loud and certain as the auctioneer’s racket"
Peter Oresick"After the Deindustrialization of America My Father Enters Television Repair""My hands hold my father’s older the wires–
picture rolls once then steadies… an English castle
A voice-over drones about Edward I
who to subdue the Welsh built castles
Some sixty years dozens of engineers the masses
conscripted from the villages

My father moves on to a Zenith
with a bad tuner TVs interest him not English
with their damp historical programming

  

Here there were Indians mound builders
Here an English fort a few farmers
And here the industrialist settled his ass
John Ford on the river dredging sand
for making glass Plate glass
Why should America buy from Europe
Some half dozen years German engineers and hundreds of Slavic peasants

Grandfather sat on his samovar
warming himself and making excuses
but finally he set off
Got a room became a shoveler
Got a wife a company house
Ford City a valley filling with properties

No one got along–
Not Labor and Capital not Germans and Slavs
not husband and wives for that matter

  

Edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century Not from Welsh armies
but the rise of the middle class
The towns around a castle thrived
tailors smithies cobblers coopers
Drawing in the Welsh peasants
And what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism…
a castle grew obsolescent

I turn off the set My father hunts
cigarettes at the Kwik-Mart on the corner
Overhead my mother’s footsteps
the tonk of bottles
the scraping of plates

  

During Eisenhower’s reign
my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn
until I took over He primed the filter
set the choke then we took turns pulling
till the sputtering engine caught
“Somanabitch” he spit
And watched me as I mowed
back and forth for two dollars

Once in the garage he showed me a scythe
He mowed hay in the old country and the women
would follow raking it in windrows

  

The factories today are mostly closed down
or full of robots or far off in Asia
Ford City lives through the mail
compensation a thin pension
and of course Social Security

I always drive along the factory windows rolled down
I want my kids in the back seat to see
Seven or eight probably pensioners congregate
on the corner each man dressed quite alike
Sears jacket cigarette salt-and-pepper hair

“Honk the horn” my oldest begs
He waves and waves zealously
until a man turns–a man
with my face but full of sweetness now
silence and clarity"
Christian WimanAfter the Diagnosis"No remembering now
when the apple sapling was blown
almost out of the ground
No telling how
with all the other trees around
it alone was struck
It must have been luck
he thought for years so close
to the house it grew
It must have been night
Change is a thing one sleeps through
when young and he was young
If there was a weakness in the earth
a give he went down on his knees
to find and feel the limits of
there is no longer
If there was one random blow from above
the way hes come to know
from years in this place
the roots were stronger
Whatever the case
he has watched this tree survive
wind ripping at his roof for nights
on end heats and blights
that left little else alive
No remembering now
A days changes mean all to him
and all days come down
to one clear pane
through which he sees
among all the other trees
this leaning clenched unyielding one
that seems cast
in the form of a blast
that would have killed it
as if something at the heart of things
and with the heart of things
had willed it"
Adrienne SuAfter the Dinner Party"Dropping napkins corks and non-compostables
into the trash I see that friends have mistaken
my everyday chopsticks for disposables

helpfully discarding them alongside inedibles
pork bones shrimp shells bitter melon
Among napkins and corks they do look compostable

off-white wooden warped from continual
washing — no lacquer no ornament But anyone
who thinks these chopsticks are disposable

doesn’t live with chopsticks in the comfortable
way of a favorite robe oversized a bit broken
Thin paper napkins plastic forks and non-compostable

takeout boxes constitute the chopstick’s natural
habitat to many I hold dear With family or alone
I’ll maintain that chopsticks aren’t disposable

but if I can make peace with the loss of utensils
when breaking bao with guests I’ll be one of them
not digging in the napkins and corks Compostable
chopsticks are the answer everyday and disposable"
Abigail DeutschAfter the Disaster"New York City 
One night not long after the disaster
as our train was passing Astor
the car door opened with a shudder
and a girl came flying down the aisle
hair that looked to be all feathers
and a half-moon smile
making open air of our small car

The crowd ignored her or they muttered
“Hey excuse me” as they passed her
when the train had paused at Rector
The specter crowed “Excuse me” swiftly
turned and ran back up the corridor
then stopped for me
We dove under the river

She took my head between her fingers
squeezing till the birds began to stir
And then from out my eyes and ears
a flock came forth — I couldn’t think or hear
or breathe or see within that feather-world
so silently I thanked her

Such things were common after the disaster"
Peter EverwineAfter the Funeral"We opened closets and bureau drawers
and packed away in boxes dresses and shoes
the silk underthings still wrapped in tissue
We sorted through cedar chests We gathered
and set aside the keepsakes and the good silver
and brought up from the coal cellar
jars of tomato sauce peppers jellied fruit
We dismantled we took down from the walls
we bundled and carted off and swept clean
Goodbye goodbye we said closing
the door behind us going our separate ways
from the house we had emptied
and which in the coming days we would fill
again and empty and try to fill again"
Robert HassAfter the Gentle Poet Kobayashi Issa"New Year’s morning—
everything is in blossom
I feel about average

A huge frog and I
staring at each other
neither of us moves

This moth saw brightness
in a woman’s chamber—
burned to a crisp

Asked how old he was
the boy in the new kimono
stretched out all five fingers

Blossoms at night
like people
moved by music

Napped half the day
no one
punished me

Fiftieth birthday

From now on
It’s all clear profit
every sky

Don’t worry spiders
I keep house
casually

These sea slugs
they just don’t seem
Japanese

Hell

Bright autumn moon
pond snails crying
in the saucepan"
Richard WilburAfter the Last Bulletins"After the last bulletins the windows darken
And the whole city founders readily and deep
Sliding on all its pillows
To the thronged Atlantis of personal sleep

And the wind rises The wind rises and bowls
The day’s litter of news in the alleys Trash
Tears itself on the railings
Soars and falls with a soft crash

Tumbles and soars again Unruly flights
Scamper the park and taking a statue for dead
Strike at the positive eyes
Batter and flap the stolid head

And scratch the noble name In empty lots
Our journals spiral in a fierce noyade
Of all we thought to think
Or caught in corners cramp and wad

And twist our words And some from gutters flail
Their tatters at the tired patrolman’s feet
Like all that fisted snow
That cried beside his long retreat

Damn you damn you to the emperor’s horse’s heels
Oh none too soon through the air white and dry
Will the clear announcer’s voice
Beat like a dove and you and I

From the heart’s anarch and responsible town
Return by subway-mouth to life again
Bearing the morning papers
And cross the park where saintlike men

White and absorbed with stick and bag remove
The litter of the night and footsteps rouse
With confident morning sound
The songbirds in the public boughs"
Cate MarvinAfter the Last Fright"I carved upon my desk unsayables
He drank until he vomited on himself
Eavesdropping the others resisted sleep
The house knew the pain of sun on lacquered floorboards

I carved it with the tips of scissors
A door creaked he hung his head into the room
Please the others cannot sleep
The shingles twitched like skin beneath moonlight

I spent the afternoon at a movie theater
He staggered through brush toward a pay phone
The others continued searching the streets for him
The house held the moon above it it was that imperial

I recall the room was empty when I came back in
He was arrested at the Quik-Trip while calling collect
Frantic the others circled the block again
The house was ghost-white older than the dead

I needle-pointed for  hours straight
He claimed the whole situation humiliated him
Relieved the others refrained from asking him what jail was like
The house was swan to field tiger to sea

I lay in bed by the time the others came home
He couldnt recall putting on the orange jumpsuit
The others asked if Id seen him around
The house shudderedNo-o-o-o

The house winced winked its blinds
The house whispered I should stay inside
The others flew out the doors and into their cars
The others slammed their cars into deer and cried

He was more humiliated than hed ever been
He looked more or less the same though his eyes were ringed
The others hid in the basement
He climbed the stairs and presented a ring

The house swung its windows wide to ice
He banged his nails blue pinned his tongue to his tie
He packed himself in a box sent it to regions far off
The others pressed their ears to the pipes

The house wore its flames like a hat
The house called a radio talk-show
We drank all night laughed all night the night he left
I shook in its mouth till the house drank me up"
Richard SchiffmanAfter the Opera"The curtain parts one last time
and the ones who killed
and were killed
who loved inordinately
who went berserk were flayed alive
descended to Hades
raged wept schemed—
victims and victimizers alike—
smile and nod and graciously bow
So glad its finally over
they stride off
suddenly a bit ridiculous
in their overwrought costumes
And the crowd—still dark
like God beyond the footlights of the world—
rises to its feet
and roars like the sea"
Alison StineAfter the Party"Sugar dries on paper plates The cake’s
decimated and barely touched What to do
with the balloons A few float listlessly
unattached still bearing like bandages
the tape that bore them to the wall
They’ve gone dull rubber tips darkening
to a bottle’s pinch It’s too late or too early
There are too many on the floor stirred up
as I stir In the end I cut them urge a blade
into the inch between knot and blossom
Slow deflation It reveals what they are
sacs of plastic stale with air I’ve seen this
before in the newspaper picture of Nefertiti
bound in the antechamber of a tomb
cast out of favor her body barely wrapped
How they know her by the queenly jaw
age of limbs and teeth Also by the broken
mouth smashed by priests so she cannot
eat cannot breathe in the afterlife"
Robert VanderMolenAfter the Phone Call"She looked nearly the same
But when I hugged her
There was substantially more
To her—no doubt as with me
She fibbed as I did at the edge
Of curb under the streetlight
As spiders dropped like tiny
Parachutes—they were difficult
To see On the periphery
Of good luck I thought
Revisiting her quirky habits
And expressions what I eventually
Found so bothersome Except
When I glanced at my watch
I discovered I was trembling
Like a small-time embezzler
I see she said you must have
An appointment The driveways
And hedges funneling back
Into darkness into someone elses
Childhood where speech was
An obstacle Wild turkeys
Approaching across the lawn
Oh no I said Im just so pleased
To see you But that didnt
Make sense either She cocked
Her head a woman with grown
Twins and three conniving husbands
Even my toes felt damp I remember
She said when youd lay your head
On my lap Id stroke your hair—
I didnt recall Though I thought
That would be a good idea now
But Im married I said I own
My own business It would have
Been helpful if Id planned
Some banter Im a high school
Principal she told me
I dont put up with horseshit
From anyone I brushed the arm
Of her jacket—she merely stared
A door slammed A grown idiot
Drooled in an attic somewhere down
The lane I had another image
As well one that held an odor
Of patchouli oil As she stepped
Forward without caution placed a hand
On my neck Take me she insisted
To those rivets of flame following
Wire—because this is it
Youll never have another
Hour I immediately felt
Calmer"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""You call me to the bath where
by evening light before bed I rub
the ointment into your maculate back
I place my hand between the wings
of your scapulae where you cannot
reach cannot see—the arc of your life
revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored
spots—and hover there awhile
remembering how we watched the lover
read the manuscript painted on the skin
of his beloved how he pressed
the words to his chest and face—and cried out
The arteries in my palm open their warmth
rising between us as I massage you neither
sexual nor umbilical
this connection—you trusting
your back to me and
me with no deceit
Only salve only unguent
Only balm"

Derek MahonAfter the Titanic"They said I got away in a boat
And humbled me at the inquiry I tell you
I sank as far that night as any
Hero As I sat shivering on the dark water
I turned to ice to hear my costly
Life go thundering down in a pandemonium of
Prams pianos sideboards winches
Boilers bursting and shredded ragtime Now I hide
In a lonely house behind the sea
Where the tide leaves broken toys and hatboxes
Silently at my door The showers of
April flowers of May mean nothing to me nor the
Late light of June when my gardener
Describes to strangers how the old man stays in bed
On seaward mornings after nights of
Wind takes his cocaine and will see no one Then it is
I drown again with all those dim
Lost faces I never understood my poor soul
Screams out in the starlight heart
Breaks loose and rolls down like a stone
Include me in your lamentations"
May Wedderburn CannanAfter the War"After the war perhaps Ill sit again
Out on the terrace where I sat with you
And see the changeless sky and hills beat blue
And live an afternoon of summer through

I shall remember then and sad at heart
For the lost day of happiness we knew
Wish only that some other man were you
And spoke my name as once you used to do"
Rachel GalvinAfter the War"For Joseph Flum
When he got to the farmhouse he rifled through
the cabinets drawers and cupboards
and his buddies did too The place was abandoned
or so he thought and his buddies did too

He tried to talk to people in town and his buddies did too
but he was the only one whose Yiddish made it
across into German They took his meaning
He in the farmhouse took a camera and a gun

but his buddies who knows About the gun
it’s also hard to say but after the war he took up
photography why not and shot beautiful women
for years Got pretty good at it and how

Won prizes and engraved plates put them in a drawer forgot
the war forgot his buddies forgot the women forgot the drawer"
Andrew HudginsAfter the Wilderness"MAY  
When Clifford wasn’t back to camp by nine
I went to look among the fields of dead
before we lost him to a common grave
But I kept tripping over living men
and had to stop and carry them to help
or carry them until they died
which happened more than once upon my back
And I got angry with those men because
they kept me from my search and I was out
still stumbling through the churned-up earth at dawn
stopping to stare into each corpse’s face
and all the while I was writing in my head
the letter I would have to send our father
saying Clifford was lost and I had lost him

I found him bent above a dying squirrel
while trying to revive the little thing
A battlefield is full of trash like that —
dead birds and squirrels bits of uniform
Its belly racked for air It couldn’t live
Cliff knew it couldn’t live without a jaw
When in relief I called his name he stared
jumped back and hissed at me like a startled cat
I edged up slowly murmuring “Clifford Cliff”
as you might talk to calm a skittery mare
and then I helped him kill and bury all
the wounded squirrels he’d gathered from the field
It seemed a game we might have played as boys
We didn’t bury them all at once with lime
the way they do on burial detail
but scooped a dozen tiny separate graves
When we were done he fell across the graves
and sobbed as though they’d been his unborn sons
His chest was large — it covered most of them
I wiped his tears and stroked his matted hair
and as I hugged him to my chest I saw
he’d wet his pants We called it Yankee tea"
Claude McKayAfter the Winter"Some day when trees have shed their leaves
And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
Have sheltered for the night
We’ll turn our faces southward love
Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
And wide-mouthed orchids smile

And we will seek the quiet hill
Where towers the cotton tree
And leaps the laughing crystal rill
And works the droning bee
And we will build a cottage there
Beside an open glade
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near
And ferns that never fade"
Gary SotoAfter Tonight"Because there are avenues
Of traffic lights a phone book
Of brothers and lawyers
Why should you think your purse
Will not be tugged from your arm
Or the screen door
Will remain latched
Against the man
Who hugs and kisses
His pillow
In the corridor of loneliness

There is a window of light
A sprinkler turning
As the earth turns
And you do not think of the hills
And of the splintered wrists it takes
To give you
The heat rising toward the ceiling

You expect your daughter
To be at the door any moment
And your husband to arrive
With the night
That is suddenly all around
You expect the stove to burst

A collar of fire
When you want it
The siamese cats
To move against your legs purring

But remember this
Because blood revolves from one lung to the next
Why think it will
After tonight"
Tom SleighAfter Vallejo"intensity and height


I want to write but only foam comes out
I want to say so much but it’s all crap —
there aren’t any numbers left that can’t be added up
nobody writes down pyramids without meaning it

I want to write but I’ve got a puma’s brains
I want to crown myself with laurel but it stinks of onions
There’s no word spoken that doesn’t dissolve in mist
there’s no god and no son of god only progress

So come on to hell with it let’s go eat weeds
eat the flesh and fruit of our stupid
tears and moans of our pickled melancholy souls

Come on Let’s go So what if   I’m wounded — let’s go
drink what’s already been drunk
let’s go crow and find another crow to fuck

Right in front of the Comédie-Française
is the Regency Cafe and right inside it there’s this room hidden
with a table and an easy chair When I go in
house dust already on its feet stands motionless

Between my lips made of rubber a cigarette butt
smolders and in the smoke you can see two intensive
smokes the cafe’s thorax and in that
thorax an oxide of elemental grief

It matters that autumn grafts itself into other autumns
it matters that autumn merges into young shoots
the cloud into half-years cheekbones into a wrinkle

It’s crucial to smell like a madman who spouts
theories about how hot snow is how fugitive the turtle
the “how” how easy how deadly the “when”


best case


Look at the very best I’m someone other —
some guy who walks around marble statues who enters
his adult clay into indexes of blood and feels
the rage and fear of the fox chased to its hole —

and if someone anoints my shoulders
with indigos of mercy I’ll declare
to my absent soul that there’s no hellishly
paradisal elsewhere for me to go

And if they try to choke me on the sea’s wafer
telling me it tastes like His flesh more acid
than sweet like Kant’s notions of truth I’ll cough

it all upNo never I’m other as a germ a satanic
tubercle a moral ache in a plesiosaur’s molar
in my posthumous suspicions all bets are off


another day of life


I’ll die in my apartment on a cold bright day
with nobody around the apartment next door gone
dead still while wind whistles through the balcony
though the branches somehow aren’t moving just as the sun

doesn’t move everything’s so quiet so frozen
Parked cars plastic bags bleached in the bare trees
a couple of those Mylar balloons tied to a chair on
the balcony next door celebrating something maybe

 now sagging listless on the floor
as if every last molecule had been pierced by a needle —
Tom Sleigh is dead he stared up into the air

the sky was pale blue as usual and he couldn’t feel
the cold coming through the window and there wasn’t
much to say or not say — and nobody anyway to say or not say it


my jailer won’t weep to be my liberator


My cell’s four walls whitening in the sun
keep counting one another — but their number
never changes despite my jailer’s
innumerable keys to chains

wrenching the nerves to their extremities
The two longer walls hurt me more — who knows why —
their salt-stained cracks like two mothers who die
after labor but give birth to twin boys

whose hands they still hold And here I am
all alone with just my right hand to make do
for both hands raising it high into

the air to search for the third arm
that between my where and my when
will father this crippled coming-of-age of a man


insomnia is the only prayer left


How childish is the spectacle of the stained
glass’s holiness the night doesn’t give a shit what
goes on inside human beings the night
has its own web of dendrites refuting the inane

prayers prayed for the dying for the confessions
going on between earthworms and earth between
the way a man argues with his own shoulder bones
All the while barracudas in a coral canyon

a sea turtle flying swim through fathoms
and fathoms of images that keep crashing
on the shore of the eye that never shuts —

and smarts in its sleeplessness staring
up into the dark shadowed by stingrays gas stations
the slow flapping wing of a lottery ticket"
John MaloneyAfter Work"They’re heading home with their lights on dust and wood glue
yellow dome lights on their metallic long beds s s—
as much overtime as you want deadline dotted line dazed
through the last few hours dried primer on their knuckles
sawdust calf-high on their jeans scraped boots the rough
plumbing and electric in way ahead of the game except for
the check such a clutter of cans and iced-tea bottles napkins
coffee cups paper plates on the front seat floor with cords
and saws tired above the eyes back of the beyond thirsty
There’s a parade of them through the two-lane highways
proudest on their way home the first turn out of the jobsite
the first song with the belt off pure breath of being alone
for now for now the insight of a full and answerable man
No one can take away the contentment of the first few miles
and they know they can’t describe it the black and purple sky"
Bob HicokAfter working sixty hours again for what reason"The best job I had was moving a stone
from one side of the road to the other
This required a permit which required
a bribe The bribe took all my salary
Yet because I hadn’t finished the job
I had no salary and to pay the bribe
I took a job moving the stone
the other way Because the official
wanted his bribe he gave me a permit
for the second job When I pointed out
that the work would be best completed
if I did nothing he complimented
my brain and wrote a letter
to my employer suggesting promotion
on stationery bearing the wings
of a raptor spread in flight
over a mountain smaller than the bird
My boss fearing my intelligence
paid me to sleep on the sofa
and take lunch with the official
who required a bribe to keep anything
from being done When I told my parents
they wrote my brother to come home
from university to be slapped
on the back of the head Dutifully
he arrived and bowed to receive
his instruction at which point
sense entered his body and he asked
what I could do by way of a job
I pointed out there were stones
everywhere trying not to move
all it took was a little gumption
to be the man who didn’t move them
It was harder to explain the intricacies
of not obtaining a permit to not
do this Just yesterday he got up
at dawn and shaved as if the lack
of hair on his face has anything
to do with the appearance of food
on an empty table"
Susanna LangAfter You Get Up Early on Memorial Day"You take the cats out with you shut
the door I have the whole wide bed all
the covers to fall back asleep in while you
cut up and sugar the strawberries grind
the coffee leave the radio off
so I wont be disturbed The room is still
dark rain forecast for the entire day
other peoples family picnics cancelled
barbecues moved into basements parades
rerouted to avoid flooded viaducts the iris
losing petals beside newly cleaned graves
their mason jars spilt into the saturated ground
But here is my holiday this drift back beneath thought
while I lie in the warm impression of your body"
Nikky Finney"The Afterbirth 
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk
Who threw soilnot salt
Over our shoulders
Who tendered close the bible
Who grew and passed around the almanac at night
So we would know
What to plant at first light

Black soil and sweet brown sorghum
From the every morning biscuits
Mama Susan fixed
Dripping and mixing
Up under our fingernails
A secret salve
Just like any other
Living simple
And keeping to our proud selves
Quite aware of night riders
Quite aware of men with
Politicious smiles
Cologned with kerosene and match

Aware of just whose feet
Walked across our tin roofs at night

We were such light sleepers
Such long distance believers

We were a family pregnant
Whose water had broke
And for once there was ham money
’Bacca money
So we thought to do better by ourselves
To begin our next row
We would go and get him
Because he was medically degreed in baby bringing
Because he was young and white and handsome
And because of that
Had been neighbor to more knowledge
Than us way back behind
The country’s proud but inferior lines

And because he came with his papers in his pocket
So convincingso soon
After his ivy graduation
Asking us hadn’t we heard
Telling us times had changed
And the midwife wasn’t safe anymore
Even though we had all been caught
By tried and true Black Grannies
Who lay ax blade sharp side up
And water pan underneath the bed
To cut the pain
To cool the fever

We were a Pregnant Clan of Kinfolk
Caught with water running down our legs
Old family say they remember
Going to fetch him
Telling him that it was time
That he should come now
But he didn’t show right away
Not right away
But came when he wanted
The next day
After his breakfast

But what more
Could we colored country folk ever want
Even if we had to watch the road all night for him
Even if we had to not let her push too hard
When he finally came
He had his papers on him
Something with one of those pretty shiny seals
Old family say they can remember
Somethin’ just wasn’t right
But we opened the screen for him anyway
Trusting
And tendering close what the Good Book
Had told us all our lives to do

Then we made him a path
Where he put his hand upthen inside
My grandmother’s womb
Her precious private pleasing place
Somewhere he probably didn’t want to touch

Then he pulled my daddy through
Somebody he probably didn’t care to reach for
And from the first he pulled him wrong
And wrong
Shattered his collarbone
And snapped his soft baby foot in half
And smashed the cartilage in his infant hand

Wringing
Their own sun baked arms
Old timey family
Remember him well
Say they knew somethin’ wasn’t right
As he came through the door
A day later
His breakfast digested now
Somethin’ just wasn’t right
How he had two waters on him
One sweetone sour-mash
One trying to throw snow quilt over the other
As he un-carefully
As drunkenly
He with his papers on him still
Stood there turning a brown baby into blue
Un-magically
And right before our eyes

Hope and Pray
Hope and Pray

Then he packed his bag andleft
With all of his official training
And gathered up gold starsleft
The Virginia land of Cumberland County

He left and forgot
He left and didn’t remember
The afterbirth inside
Carlene Godwin Finney

To clabber
Gangrene
Close down
Her place
Her precious private pleasing place
To fill the house to the rafters
Up past the dimpled tin roof
With a rotting smell
That stayed for nine days
That mortgaged a room
In our memories
And did not die with her

We were a Brown and Pregnant Family
And he would’ve remembered his schoolin’
And left his bottle
Recollected his manners
And brought his right mind
Had another klan called him to their bedside
He would’ve come right away
He would’ve never had liquor on his breath
If the color of my daddy’s broken limbs
Had matched the color of his own but

We were a Colored Clan of Kinfolk
We should’ve met him at the door
Should’ve told him lean first into the rusty screen
Made him open up his mouth and blow
Breathe out right there
Into all of our brown and lined up faces
In wait of his worthiness

Then just for good measure
Should’ve made him blow once again
Into Papa Josh’s truth telling jar
Just to be sure
Should’ve let Mama Sally
Then Aunt Nanny
Then lastly Aunt Mary
Give him the final once over
And hold his sterile hands
Down to the firelight to check
Just like she checked our own every night
Before supper
Before we were allowed to sit
At her very particular table

We could’ve let Aunt Ira clutch him by his chin
Enter and leave through her eyes
Just like how she came and went through us
Everyday at her leisure

She would’ve took care to notice
As she traveled all up and through him
Any shakingany sweating
And caught his incapable belligerent incompetence
In time

Oh Jesus

We should’ve let Grandpop Robert
Have him from the first
Should’ve let him pick him up
By the back of his pants
And swirl him around
Just like he picked us up
And swirled us around
Anytime he caught us lying or lazy
Or being less than what we were

We should’ve let Grandpop
Loose on him from the start
And he would’ve held him up
High eye to the sun
And looked straight through him
Just like he held us up
And then we would have known first
Like he always knew first
And brought to us
The very map of his heart
Then we would have known
Just what his intentions were
With our Carlene

Before we knew his name
Or cared about his many degrees
Before he dared reach upthen inside
Our family’s brown globe
While we stood there
Some of us throwing good black soil
With one hand
Some of us tending close
The Good Book with the other
Believing and trusting
We were doing better
By this one
Standing there

Waterfalls running
Screaming whitewater rapids

Down our pants legs
Down our pantaloons
To our many selves

All the while
Praying hard
That maybe we were wrong
please make us wrong
One hundred proof
Smelled the same as
Isopropyl"
Audre LordeAfterimages"I
However the image enters
its force remains within
my eyes
rockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve
wild for life relentless and acquisitive
learning to survive
where there is no food
my eyes are always hungry
and remembering
however the image enters
its force remains
A white woman stands bereft and empty
a black boy hacked into a murderous lesson
recalled in me forever
like a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep
etched into my visions
food for dragonfish that learn
to live upon whatever they must eat
fused images beneath my pain

II
The Pearl River floods through the streets of Jackson
A Mississippi summer televised
Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain
a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing boat
her fingers tarry for a moment on the chimney
now awash
tearless and no longer young she holds
a tattered babys blanket in her arms
In a flickering afterimage of the nightmare rain
a microphone
thrust up against her flat bewildered words
“we jest come from the bank yestiddy
borrowing money to pay the income tax
now everythings gone I never knew
it could be so hard”
Despair weighs down her voice like Pearl River mud
caked around the edges
her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation
unanswered
she shifts her search across the watered street dry-eyed
“hard but not this hard”
Two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her
hanging upon her coat like mirrors
until a man with ham-like hands pulls her aside
snarling “She aint got nothing more to say”
and that lie hangs in his mouth
like a shred of rotting meat

III
I inherited Jackson Mississippi
For my majority it gave me Emmett Till
his  years puffed out like bruises
on plump boy-cheeks
his only Mississippi summer
whistling a  gun salute to Dixie
as a white girl passed him in the street
and he was baptized my son forever
in the midnight waters of the Pearl

His broken body is the afterimage of my st year
when I walked through a northern summer
my eyes averted
from each corners photographies
newspapers protest posters magazines
Police Story Confidential True
the avid insistence of detail
pretending insight or information
the length of gash across the dead boys loins
his grieving mothers lamentation
the severed lips how many burns
his gouged out eyes
sewed shut upon the screaming covers
louder than life
all over
the veiled warning the secret relish
of a black childs mutilated body
fingered by street-corner eyes
bruise upon livid bruise
and wherever I looked that summer
I learned to be at home with childrens blood
with savored violence
with pictures of black broken flesh
used crumpled and discarded
lying amid the sidewalk refuse
like a raped womans face

A black boy from Chicago
whistled on the streets of Jackson Mississippi
testing what hed been taught was a manly thing to do
his teachers
ripped his eyes out his sex his tongue
and flung him to the Pearl weighted with stone
in the name of white womanhood
they took their aroused honor
back to Jackson
and celebrated in a whorehouse
the double ritual of white manhood
confirmed

“If earth and air and water do not judge them who are
we to refuse a crust of bread”"
Bruce SniderAfterlife"I wake to leafless vines and muddy fields
patches of standing water His pocketknife

waits in my dresser drawer still able to gut fish
I pick up his green shirt put it on for the fourth day

in a row Outside the rusty nail he hammered
catches me leaves its stain on everything

The temperature drops the whole shore
filling with him his dented chew can waders

the cattails kinked bowing their distress
At the pier I use his old pliers to ready the line

fatheads darters a blood worm jig Today the lake’s
one truth is hardness When the trout bite

I pull the serviceable things glistening into air"
Hayden CarruthThe Afterlife Letter to Sam Hamill"You may think it strange Sam that Im writing
a letter in these circumstances I thought
it strange too—the first time But theres
a misconception I was laboring under and you
are too viz that the imagination in your
vicinity is free and powerful After all
you say youve been creating yourself all
along imaginatively You imagine yourself
playing golf or hiking in the Olympics or
writing a poem and then it becomes true
But you still have to do it you have to exert
yourself will courage whatever youve got youre
mired in the unimaginative Here I imagine a letter
and its written Takes about two-fifths of a
second your time Hell this is heaven man
I can deluge Congress with letters telling
every one of those mendacious sons of bitches
exactly what he or she is in maybe about
half an hour In spite of your Buddhist
proclivities when you imagine bliss
you still must struggle to get there By the way
the Buddha has his place across town on
Elysian Drive We call him Bud Hes lost weight
and got new dentures and he looks a hell of a
lot better than he used to He always carries
a jumping jack with him everywhere just
for contemplation but he doesnt make it
jump He only looks at it Meanwhile Sidney
and Dizzy Uncle Ben and Papa Yancey are
over by Sylvesters Grot making the sweetest
cheerfulest blues you ever heard The air
so called is full of it Poems are fluttering
everywhere like seed from a cottonwood tree
Sam the remarkable truth is I can do any
fucking thing I want Speaking of which
theres this dazzling young Naomi who
wiped out on I- just west of Truckee
last winter and I think this is the moment
for me to go and pay her my respects
Dont go way Ill be right back"
Roy FisherThe Afterlife"I’ve lived within half a mile of it
for twenty years West
by the black iron weather-hen
half-strangled with clematis
on the garage roof
I can locate it Past a low ridge
in the cliff face of a limestone dale
there’s a cave in the bushes

When the old tigers
were long since gone leaving their
teeth the valley people
would climb there with the dead
they thought most useful

push them well in

take them out again
walk them around
‘They’re coming They’re coming’

We Malagasies love
our second burials
We hire a band that comes
in a van Again
with liquefaction almost done
we hold our cherished ones
in our arms From the grave-clothes
they fall in gobbets as dog-food
falls from the can We wrap them
in fresh dry linen They
bless our lives with their happiness

Walk them around the valley Drop
here a finger
for the god that is a rat or a raven
here a metatarsal
to set under the hearth for luck

And what was luck

The afterlife back then
was fairly long
nothing demented like for ever

nothing military The afterlife
would come to the party"
Derek MahonAfterlives"for James Simmons


I wake in a dark flat
To the soft roar of the world
Pigeons neck on the white
Roofs as I draw the curtains
And look out over London
Rain-fresh in the morning light

This is our element the bright
Reason on which we rely
For the long-term solutions
The orators yap and guns
Go off in a back street
But the faith doesn’t die

That in our time these things
Will amaze the literate children
In their non-sectarian schools
And the dark places be
Ablaze with love and poetry
When the power of good prevails

What middle-class shits we are
To imagine for one second
That our privileged ideals
Are divine wisdom and the dim
Forms that kneel at noon
In the city not ourselves





I am going home by sea
For the first time in years
Somebody thumbs a guitar
On the dark deck while a gull
Dreams at the masthead
The moon-splashed waves exult

At dawn the ship trembles turns
In a wide arc to back
Shuddering up the grey lough
Past lightship and buoy
Slipway and dry dock
Where a naked bulb burns

And I step ashore in a fine rain
To a city so changed
By five years of war
I scarcely recognize
The places I grew up in
The faces that try to explain

But the hills are still the same
Grey-blue above Belfast
Perhaps if I’d stayed behind
And lived it bomb by bomb
I might have grown up at last
And learnt what is meant by home"
Henry Wadsworth LongfellowAftermath"When the summer fields are mown
When the birds are fledged and flown
And the dry leaves strew the path
With the falling of the snow
With the cawing of the crow
Once again the fields we mow
And gather in the aftermath

Not the sweet new grass with flowers
Is this harvesting of ours
Not the upland clover bloom
But the rowen mixed with weeds
Tangled tufts from marsh and meads
Where the poppy drops its seeds
In the silence and the gloom"
Pierre ReverdyAfternoon"In the morning that comes up behind the roof in the shelter of the bridge in the corner of  the cypresses that rise above the wall a rooster has crowed In the bell tower that rips the air with its shining point the notes ring out and already the morning din can be heard in the street the only street that goes from the river to the mountain dividing the woods One looks for some other words but the ideas are always just as dark just as simple and singularly painful There is hardly more than the eyes the open air the grass and the water in the distance with around every bend a well or a cool basin In the right-hand corner the last house with a larger head at the window The trees are extremely alive and all those familiar companions walk along the demolished wall that is crushed into the thorns with bursts of laughter Above the ravine the din augments swells and if the car passes on the upper road one no longer knows if it is the flowers or the little bells that are chiming Under the blazing sun when the landscape is on fire the traveler crosses the stream on a very narrow bridge before a dark hole where the trees line the water that falls asleep in the afternoon And against the trembling background of the woods the motionless man"
Edgar BowersAn Afternoon at the Beach"I’ll go among the dead to see my friend
The place I leave is beautiful the sea
Repeats the winds’ far swell in its long sound
And there beside it houses solemnly
Shine with the modest courage of the land
While swimmers try the verge of what they see

I cannot go although I should pretend
Some final self whose phantom eye could see
Him who because he is not cannot change
And yet the thought of going makes the sea
The land the swimmers and myself seem strange
Almost as strange as they will someday be"
Carolyn KizerAfternoon Happiness"for John
At a party I spy a handsome psychiatrist
And wish as we all do to get her advice for free
Doctor I’ll say I’m supposed to be a poet
All life’s awfulness has been grist to me
We learn that happiness is a Chinese meal
While sorrow is a nourishment forever
My new environment is California Dreamer
I’m fearful I’m forgetting how to brood
And Doctor another thing has got me worried
I’m not drinking as much as I should   

At home I want to write a happy poem
On love or a love poem of happiness
But they won’t do the tensions of every day
The rub the minor abrasions of any two
Who share one space Ah there’s no substitute for tragedy
But in this chapter tragedy belongs
To that other life the old life before us
Here is my aphorism of the day
Happy people are monogamous
Even in California So how does the poem play

Without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss
I don’t have a jealous eye or fear
And neither do you In truth I’m fond
Of your ex-mate whom I name “my wife-in-law”
My former husband that old disaster is now just funny
So laugh we do in what Cyril Connolly
Has called the endless nocturnal conversation
Of marriage Which may be the best part
Darling must I love you in light verse
Without the tribute of profoundest art

Of course it won’t last You will break my heart
Or I yours by dying I could weep over that
But now it seems forced here in these heaven hills
The mourning doves mourning the squirrels mating
My old cat warm in my lap here on our terrace
As from below comes a musical cursing
As you mend my favorite plate Later of course
I could pick a fight there is always material in that
But we don’t come from fighting people those
Who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate

No love the heavy poem will have to come
From temps perdu fertile with pain or perhaps
Detonated by terrors far beyond this place
Where the world rends itself and its tainted waters
Rise in the east to erode our safety here
Much as I want to gather a lifetime thrift
And craft my cunning skills tied in a knot for you
There is only this useless happiness as gift"
C P CavafyThe Afternoon Sun"This room how well I know it
Now they’re renting it and the one next to it
as offices The whole house has become
an office building for agents businessmen companies

This room how familiar it is

The couch was here near the door
a Turkish carpet in front of it
Close by the shelf with two yellow vases
On the right—no opposite—a wardrobe with a mirror
In the middle the table where he wrote
and the three big wicker chairs
Beside the window the bed
where we made love so many times

They must still be around somewhere those old things

Beside the window the bed
the afternoon sun used to touch half of it

   One afternoon at four o’clock we separated
for a week only   And then—
that week became forever"
Michael AnaniaAfternoons"Quick passage into
memory and behind
only blank spaces

blue stain on pink
litmus or merely
known so closely

something falls away
receding from touch
caught in the air

your fingers move
agile water-fly
padding the surface

of what is seen
even among these
defractions bent

pencil or warps
of a flat eye
the wide world circling"
David BakerAfterwards"A short ride in the van then the eight of us
there in the heat—white shirtsleeves sticking
the women’s gloves off—fanning our faces
The workers had set up a big blue tent

to help us at graveside tolerate the sun
which was brutal all afternoon as if
stationed above us though it moved limb
to limb through two huge covering elms

The long processional of neighbors friends
the town’s elderly her beauty-shop patrons
her club’s notables   The world is full of
prayers arrived at from afterwards he said

Look up through the trees—the hands the leaves
curled as in self-control or quietly hurting
or now open flat-palmed many-fine-veined
and whether from heat or sadness waving"
Margaret Postgate ColeAfterwards"Oh my beloved shall you and I
Ever be young again be young again"
Louise Glück"Afterword
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""Reading what I have just written I now believe
I stopped precipitously so that my story seems to have been
slightly distorted ending as it did not abruptly
but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort
sprayed onto stages to allow for difficult set changes

Why did I stop Did some instinct
discern a shape the artist in me
intervening to stop traffic as it were

A shape Or fate as the poets say
intuited in those few long ago hours—

I must have thought so once
And yet I dislike the term
which seems to me a crutch a phase
the adolescence of the mind perhaps—

Still it was a term I used myself
frequently to explain my failures
Fate destiny whose designs and warnings
now seem to me simply
local symmetries metonymic
baubles within immense confusion—

Chaos was what I saw
My brush froze—I could not paint it

Darkness silence that was the feeling

What did we call it then
A “crisis of vision” corresponding I believed
to the tree that confronted my parents

but whereas they were forced
forward into the obstacle
I retreated or fled—

Mist covered the stage my life
Characters came and went costumes were changed
my brush hand moved side to side
far from the canvas
side to side like a windshield wiper

Surely this was the desert the dark night
In reality a crowded street in London
the tourists waving their colored maps

One speaks a wordI
Out of this stream
the great forms—

I took a deep breath And it came to me
the person who drew that breath
was not the person in my story his childish hand
confidently wielding the crayon—

Had I been that person A child but also
an explorer to whom the path is suddenly clear for whom
the vegetation parts—

And beyond no longer screened from view that exalted
solitude Kant perhaps experienced
on his way to the bridges—
We share a birthday

Outside the festive streets
were strung in late January with exhausted Christmas lights
A woman leaned against her lover’s shoulder
singing Jacques Brel in her thin soprano—

Bravo the door is shut
Now nothing escapes nothing enters—

I hadn’t moved I felt the desert
stretching ahead stretching it now seems
on all sides shifting as I speak

so that I was constantly
face to face with blankness that
stepchild of the sublime

which it turns out
has been both my subject and my medium

What would my twin have said had my thoughts
reached him

Perhaps he would have said
in my case there was no obstacle for the sake of argument
after which I would have been
referred to religion the cemetery where
questions of faith are answered

The mist had cleared The empty canvases
were turned inward against the wall

The little cat is deadso the song went

Shall I be raised from death the spirit asks
And the sun says yes
And the desert answers
your voice is sand scattered in wind"
Mark RudmanAfterword"Where the Story Leaves Off

We had set out the four of us like pilgrims
It’s a quick jaunt to Guanajuato from San Miguel
over long stretches of restless earth
not desert not valley
patchy green on tawny ground
head to head in the passing lane
with a pick-up sprouting children
and a blunderbuss fifties’ Chevy
with no hood over its engine with its insides exposed
A quick jaunt to the underworld the gauzy mummies
But we lingered in the marketplace
the two women—my cousin’s wife my lover—
poring over shawls and serapes
my cousin clicking away with his Nikon and zoom
at the gargoyles’ leering and capricious faces

while I lost myself among the hawkers’ masks—
swinging like lanterns on the standards—
blessed and damned with edgy angular
yet impassive facades
And made of no special wood
I wanted one anyway and forked out eight pesos
It’s hard crawling through the crypt
You have to get down on your hands and knees
and the openings were meant
for smaller people unless the getting down
was part of a solemn ritual
It was a relief to be in the cool of the underworld
away from the tension of the light
The dead were well preserved
They stood upright They stayed together
I couldn’t have known it then but soon
my cousin his wife my lover—soon
we would all be lost to each other forever—
not taken by death

just gone into another kind of dust"
Robert BurnsAfton Water"Flow gently sweet Afton among thy green braes
Flow gently Ill sing thee a song in thy praise
My Marys asleep by thy murmuring stream
Flow gently sweet Afton disturb not her dream

Thou stock-dove whose echo resounds thro the glen
Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den
Thou green-crested lapwing thy screaming forbear
I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair

How lofty sweet Afton thy neighbouring hills
Far markd with the courses of clear winding rills
There daily I wander as noon rises high
My flocks and my Marys sweet cot in my eye

How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below
Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow
There oft as mild Evning sweeps over the lea
The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me

Thy crystal stream Afton how lovely it glides
And winds by the cot where my Mary resides
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave
As gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave

Flow gently sweet Afton among thy green braes
Flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays
My Marys asleep by thy murmuring stream
Flow gently sweet Afton disturb not her dream"
Ross GayAgain"Because I love you and beneath the uncountable stars
I have become the delicate piston threading itself through your chest

I want to tell you a story I shouldn’t but will and in the meantime neglect Love
the discordant melody spilling from my ears but attend

instead to this tale for a river burns inside my mouth
and it wants both purgation and to eternally sip your thousand drippings

and in the story is a dog and unnamed it leads to less heartbreak
so name him Max and in the story are neighborhood kids

who spin a yarn about Max like I’m singing to you except they tell a child
a boy who only moments earlier had been wending through sticker bushes

to pick juicy rubies whose chin was in fact stained with them
and combining in their story the big kids make

the boy who shall remain unnamed believe Max to be sick and rabid
and say his limp and regular smell of piss are just two signs

but the worst of it they say is that he’ll likely find you in the night
and the big kids do not giggle and the boy does not giggle

but lets the final berries in his hand drop into the overgrowth
at his feet and if I spoke the dream of the unnamed boy

I fear my tongue would turn an arm of fire so I won’t but
know inside the boy’s head grew a fire beneath the same stars

as you and I Love your leg between mine the fine hairs
on your upper thigh nearly glistening in the night and the boy

the night the incalculable mysteries as he sleeps with a stuffed animal
tucked beneath his chin and rolls tight against his brother

in their shared bed who rolls away and you know by now
there is no salve to quell his mind’s roaring machinery

and I shouldn’t tell you but I will
the unnamed boy

on the third night of the dreams which harden his soft face
puts on pants and a sweatshirt and quietly takes the spade from the den

and more quietly leaves his house where upstairs his father lies dreamless
and his mother bends her body into his

and beneath these same stars Love which often when I study them
seem to recede like so many of the lies of light

the boy walks to the yard where Max lives attached to a steel cable
spanning the lawn and the boy brings hot dogs which he learned

from Tom amp Jerry and nearly urinating in his pants he tosses them
toward the quiet and crippled thing limping across the lawn

the cable whispering above the dew-slick grass and Max whimpers
and the boy sees a wolf where stands this ratty

and sad and groveling dog and beneath these very stars
Max raises his head to look at the unnamed boy

with one glaucous eye nearly glued shut
and the other wet from the cool breeze and wheezing

Max catches the gaze of the boy who sees
at last the raw skin on the dogs flank the quiver

of his spindly legs and as Max bends his nose
to the franks the boy watches him struggle

to snatch the meat with gums and bringing the shovel down
he bends to lift the meat to Maxs toothless mouth

and rubs the length of his throat and chin
Max arching his neck with his eyes closed now

and licking the boys round face until the boy unchains the dog
and stands taking slow steps backward through the wet grass and feels

for the first time in days the breath in his lungs which is cool
and a little damp spilling over his small lips and he feels

again his feet beneath him and the earth beneath them and starlings
singing the morning in and the somber movement of beetles

chewing the leaves of the white birch glinting in the dark and he notices
Darling an upturned nest beneath the tree and flips it looking for the blueeggs

of robins but finds none and placing a rumpled crimson feather in hismouth
slips the spindly thicket into another tree which he climbs

to watch the first hint of light glancing above the fields and the boy
eventually returns to his thorny fruit bush where an occasional prick

leaves on his arm or leg a spot of blood the color of these raspberries
and tasting of salt and filling his upturned shirt with them he beams

that he could pull from the earth that which might make you smile
Love which you’ll find in the fridge on the bottom shelf behind the milk

in the bowl you made with your own lovely hands"
Ha Jin"Again These Days I Have Been Thinking of You""
When we were leaving home for the army
you burst into tears on the train
You said “I will miss my parents
I have never travelled that far”
But you also claimed
it was everyone’s duty to defend the country
and you would fight the Russian Revisionists
to the dead end

I lowered my head and did not cry
But my mother’s eyes dimmed with tears
were striving in the cold wind
to hold back the train going to the North


On the Northern land
our foot-prints
disappeared in the snow
The hard ice was slowly
losing its layers

We didn’t have to wear fur hats
on our patrols along the borderline
and watered our horses at little springs


At last the rain loosened the black earth
Azaleas bloomed on the mountain slopes

The woods did not understand war
The mountains and the rivers did not understand war

But every night we slept
with our clothes on

We were prepared to fight


The tanks which played the enemy
were running through the valley
Wooden grenades and rubber bazooka-projectiles
started raining towards them

Everything was false
but we did it seriously

Why did you choose that tank
with a revolving barrel like a gigantic scythe
to lay an explosive package at its back

It laid you on the ground
and its caterpillar ran over your limbs

We carried you down the hill
Your blood dropped into a small brook
flowing towards the Amur


White ceilings
white walls
white nurses
Only your black eyes were sliding slowly

Our eyes collided
You were staring at me
in deadly silence

Can you speak
Can you hear what others say
You are two feet shorter than before

You sluggishly turned into your ward
like a startled turtle

Watching your warped back
I was sending off an epoch


Are you still alive

You are a little dog abandoned
often groaning at the door
of my conscience

Tonight in the long silence
again I am thinking of you"
Roddy LumsdenAgainst Complaint"After the Yoruba
Though the amaryllis sags and spills
so do those my wishes serve all along the town
And yes the new moon kinked there in nights patch
tugs me so—but I cant reach to right the slant
And though our cat pads past without a tail some
with slinking tails peer one-eyed at the dawn some
with eyes are clawless some with sparking claws
contain no voice with which to sing
of foxes gassing in the lane
Round-shouldered pals
parade smart shirts while my broad back supports
a scrubby jumper fawn or taupe
The balding English
air their stubble while some headless hero sports
a feathered hat I know a man whose thoroughbred
grazes in his porch for want of livery
There are scholars of Kant who cant find Kent
on the map and men of Kent who cannot
fathom Kant
We who would polish off a feast have lain
late in our beds our bellies groaning throats on fire
We whod drain a vat of wine have drunk
our own blood for its sting
Each of us in tatters flaunts
one treasured garment flapping in the wind"
Roddy LumsdenAgainst Conceit"Dont say Sir Pigeon in his cobalt bonnet
Dont find among your notes
jottings on duvets and blizzards and the page

unwalked across black missives of girlhood
must be sent off and do not claim the furnace
of the universe is powered by human screams

When the dark turns dark
or when the bullet lifts a scalp
it is enough to know the lover feels the slap

that the world can hear the sharp shout
which wakes the cat
her claws one inch from the rabbits bobbing scut"
Fred MarchantAgainst Epiphany"What god was it that would open
earth’s picture book and see the two
of us on a road snowfields glittering
on every side and poplars bent like
the fingers of an old man clutching
what he loved about the sun

Which one was it that would peer
into our thatched white-washed
farmhouse and see the fur flies
and shit-stained walls Which one
laughed at the barbed wire fences
the wall topped with broken glass

Which of the many who came then
gleaming and rimed in hard sunlight
Which of those who bobbed like ice
along the winter shore What did
we have that any god would want
Quick if you can find it hide it"
Clive JamesAgainst Gregariousness"Facing the wind the hovering stormy petrels
Tap-dance on the water
They pluck the tuna hatchlings
As Pavlova had she been in a tearing hurry
Might once have picked up pearls
From a broken necklace

Yellowfin drive the turbine of sardines
Up near the surface so the diving shearwaters
Can fly down through the bubbles and get at them
Birds from above and big fish from below
Rip at the pack until it comes apart
Like Poland with survivors in single figures

The krill as singletons almost not there
But en masse like a cloud of diamond dust
Against the sunlit flood of their ballroom ceiling
Are scooped up by the basking shark’s dragline
Or sucked in through the whale’s drapes of baleen—
A galaxy absorbed into a boudoir
And nullified a deep-space mass extinction
Watched only by the Hubble telescope

Make your bones in a shark family if you can
If not be tricky to locate for sheer
Translucence a slick blip that will become—
Beyond the daisycutter beaks and jaws—
A lobster fortified with jutting eaves
Of glazed tile like the castle at Nagoya
Hoisted around by jacks and cranes an awkward
Mouthful like a crushed car That being done
Crawl backwards down a hole and don’t come out"
Grace BauerAgainst Lawn"The midnight streetlight illuminating
the white of clover assures me

I am right not to manicure
my patch of grass into a dull

carpet of uniform green but
to allow whatever will to take over

Somewhere in that lace lies luck
though I may never swoop down

to find it Three too is
an auspicious number And this seeing

a reminder to avoid too much taming
of what even here wants to be wild"
Roddy LumsdenAgainst Naturism"I realise it’s not all salad sandwiches
at pinewood picnics endless volleyball
I’ve heard the argument that talk of shame
and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty
how weve all got one Seen one seen ’em all

But it’s not for me beneath my double load
of Calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies
For me I have to see the clothes come off
the way a button’s thumbed through cotton cloth -
a winning move in some exotic game

with no set rules but countless permutations -
or how a summer dress falls to the floor
with momentary mass and with a plash
that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion
a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip

three fingertips that follow down the spine
to where a clasp is neatly spun undone
amidkiss by prime legerdemain
and who cares that it happens once in four
and never never on the first undressing

it must be better than a foreskin snagged
on gorse thorns or a cold fat nipple jammed
in the scissor drawer the bounty and the blessing
the mystery of nakedness reduced
till on a par with go-go palaces

where goosebumped grinding strippers strut their stuff
in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses
down on a par with the oncologist
who gropes for lumps the night-morgue man who clips
his nails amongst the naked bin-bagged stiffs

So stranger what I want to say is this
if you’re to join me in a little sinning
and this is my place up here on the right
please understand I’d value some reluctance
a cold-feet shiver as in the beginning

when Eve discovered modesty and slipped
in and out of something comfortable
For there are many ways to skin a cat
but ours is human nature - things come off
so rarely Come in Let me take your coat"
Donald RevellAgainst Pluralism"Who will you point to In the needles eye
or selling what you won at the strait gate
who will know how to kiss you and just when
to pull the hair at your neck and say your name
No single victim will ever be the last
Not at least until one victim purifies
the whole issue of suffering
by crying out that his pain means nothing
because it comes from nowhere and goes nowhere
The clusters of exiles in their storefronts
will be free then History will end
Lover will take her hand from her lovers mouth
and see only his mouth not a sightless
fishs eye scored onto the sheets marble

Its a wise child who knows it is no angel
The rest of us grow up hovering visiting
our lives in the moment of pain or orgasm
or when the little fingers of pity push
inside us and we feel loved Our suffering
gales beneath our wings like applause
We long to repeat it to explain it
to stay aloft and clear our lives in that
mid-heaven of nostalgia and apology
We hover over the camps the forced retreats
the ends of nations that no one can recall now
except as code words for catastrophe
We alight for pleasure touching the victims
as the hurt husband touches the bed his wife has left

Father loved you with a passion Or else
from fear of your long inarticulate future
he turned silent edging into crank broadcasts
by a small radio on the screened porch
Perhaps as my father did he moved out
into another house and had a daughter
with a redheaded woman who mistook his silence
for grief My father never lost anything
For years I went to school with the daughter
as she grew fat and her red hair reached her knees
Who were the victims At what moment
should my father have cried out the mothers
have cried out or I have taken the fat hand
of my sister and walked off through the needles eye

And its a wise child who can understand
that the mothers and fathers on the trains
see only the receding pastorals
the lamplit villages of other angels
and that his suffering is only one pinpoint
on a lithic hoarding of departures
each passenger reads like an advertisement of heaven
The wise child goes crazy How could he not
How could he not be heartbroken to learn
that even compassion is compassionless that it uses
the real or imagined pain of others and himself
for wings for memory for a marriage proposal
for the cruel angelism that adores victims
and makes a fifth airier element out of pain

We recede We recede A virus finds
that place deepest behind the heart where it
unweaves itself into a pattern of false starts
like knots of villages and the one house
lightening at the crest of a green street
as its doors close to us Dearest
that is another crime of pluralism
Hope jagged with beginnings scatters
our one real life among a dozen houses
little illnesses of longing whose low
fevers contract the heart You have but one heart
And I have one At the crest of a green street
we give them away The night thanks us
The fences shiver with cats and the flowers close

Feeling comes from nowhere and goes nowhere
It is not a train It is not one instance
of lovemaking or a lifetime spent together
running the dogs dying finally face down
in the yard bed of herbs We are all the same
Or rather we should believe we are the same
in order to be happy with the same things
and not to be stealing from each other
We put each other in camps I crush my lover with a kiss
and then it is impossible to love her
What must die if we are to live without barbed wire
and bad sex is the very idea of otherness
And to kill the idea we have merely to find
one victim in ourselves who will die for nothing

My father could not stop getting children
The people on the trains cannot stop watching
the passing villages for their own ghosts
and early angels I cannot stop finding
houses in which to lose my heart a dozen times
in the fits and starts of a little passion exalted
Life is not going to be bearable I think
for a long time The exiles will play cards
in their storefront lodges History will slide on
And one will pull the hair at my neck And one
will cover my mouth as she makes love to me
The streets are snowed in under heavens leaflets
Our beds are scored with the sightless eyes the eyes of others
The air is sickeningly heavy with applause"
David IgnatowAgainst the Evidence"As I reach to close each book
lying open on my desk it leaps up
to snap at my fingers My legs
won’t hold me I must sit down
My fingers pain me
where the thick leaves snapped together
at my touch
All my life
I’ve held books in my hands
like children carefully turning
their pages and straightening out
their creases I use books
almost apologetically I believe
I often think their thoughts for them
Reading I never know where theirs leave off
and mine begin I am so much alone
in the world I can observe the stars
or study the breeze I can count the steps
on a stair on the way up or down
and I can look at another human being
and get a smile knowing
it is for the sake of politeness
Nothing must be said of estrangement
among the human race and yet
nothing is said at all
because of that
But no book will help either
I stroke my desk
its wood so smooth so patient and still
I set a typewriter on its surface
and begin to type
to tell myself my troubles
Against the evidence I live by choice"
Eleanor Ross TaylorAgainst the Kitchen Wall"A mothball May
I lean against the kitchen wall
The sacred pear tree on the hill
The skyline small green wheat
waverunning with the wind

From west to east the green’s
spanned out by men
on horseback and on foot
men with long staffs
slow-motion searching

The saddles glint
What are they sweeping for
Why coming this direction
Are those staffs guns

If  they are after quail or hares
why is their fanning law-enforcement grim
as for a felon a missing person or
one too imbecile to find her way

One who laid waste
the safe place by the kitchen wall
bankrupted her May day
malpracticed pear and gifted wheat

I’m waiting men"
Alan R ShapiroAgainst Translation"The songs swept down from the northern steppes
with cinerary horse
and sword and vestment
in the wake of battle
suicidal for a bronze
translation of flesh burnt
to a vertical vapor trail
of fame which so they claimed
would be undying
by which they meant
the dying would be just
prolonged
a little longer
as on a ladder
made of air each
legendary smoke of name could only climb
by thinning
till it wasn’t there

And now as the steel tips of our devices
dig sort through
and analyze
what’s left behind
scant traces
of berserk debris dumb soot of ritual effaced
by dumber ash
beneath ghost towns
the ghosts have all abandoned
all we unearth
intact now
are the untranslated
bones of babies
inhumed at home in older dwellings
on deeper strata
under mud floors
in pits — placed
carefully on sides knees drawn to chests

skulls cupped in pebble bones of hand
the dead nursling
the stillborn
the miscarried — unnamed
unadorned
as if the only grave goods
buried with them were
their perishing —
as if that
were what the mothers
wanted to keep close
keep hidden safe
from the heroic
stench of burning
upward while their breasts
still swelling dripping
freshened the black dirt
sucking at their feet"
Michael RyanAgainst Which"habit smacks
its dull skull
like a stuck bull
in a brick stall

and my version
of what I know
is like eye surgery
with a backhoe

on grace
so much beyond
my pitiful gray
sponge of a brain

Id not believe it exists
except for such
doses of felicity
as this"
Jack ConwayThe Agamemnon Rag"Atlas you’re Homer I am so glad you’re Hera
Thera so many things to tell you I went on that
minotaur of the museum The new display centaurs
on how you can contract Sisyphus if you don’t use
a Trojan on your Dictys It was all Greek to me see
When I was Roman around
I rubbed Midas against someone “Medea you look like a Goddess”
he said The Minerva him I told him to
Frigg off oracle the cops “Loki here” I said
“In Odin times men had better manners” It’s best to try
and nymph that sort of thing in the bud He said he knew
Athena two about women like me then tried to Bacchus
into a corner Dryads I could he wouldn’t stop
“Don’t Troy with my affections” he said
“I’m already going to Helen a hand basket”
I pretended to be completely Apollo by his behavior
If something like that Mars your day it Styx with you
forever “I’m not Bragi” he said “But Idon better”
Some people will never Lerna Juno what I did
Valhalla for help I knew the police would
Pegasus to the wall The Sirens went off
Are you or Argonaut guilty they asked
He told the cops he was Iliad bad clams
He said he accidentally Electra Cupid himself
trying to adjust a lamp shade This job has its
pluses and Minos The cops figured he was Fulla it
He nearly Runic for me I’m telling you
it was quite an Odyssey but I knew things would
Pan out And oh by the way here’s all his gold
I was able to Fleece him before the museum closed"
Timothy MurphyAgape"The night you died I dreamed you came to camp
to hear confession from an Eagle Scout
tortured by forty years of sin and doubt
You whispered vespers by a hissing lamp

Handlers allowing you to hike with me
followed us to the Bad Axe waterfront
down a ﬁrebreak this camper used to hunt
Through all I said you suffered silently

I blamed the authors of my unbelief
St Paul who would have deemed my love obscene
the Jesuit who raped me as a teen
the altar boy when I was six the grief

of a child chucked from Eden left for dead
by Peter’s Church and all the choirs above
In a thick Polish accent choked with love"
Philip SchultzAge Appropriate"Sometimes
mystified by the behavior
of one of my sons
my wife will point out
if   it’s age-appropriate
making me wonder why
I still shout at ballplayers on
tv

and argue with the dead
Last week my oldest son
with a wild pitch turned
my left ankle into an eggplant
I didn’t yell at the doctors
who refused my insurance
or get angry with a friend
who told me to soak it
in bourbon and garlic No
I read Montaigne who said
self-revelation is the purpose
of discourse which in his day
meant knowing whether
to be flattered if a friend
didn’t use a food-taster
or amused if a witch cast a spell
of   weeping on an in-law
Blaise Monluc the king’s
lieutenant general during
the civil wars Montaigne says
threw so many hanged Protestants
down a well you could reach in
and touch the top one’s head Yes
Monluc who was fond of saying
“When the scaffolds are full use trees”
knew what was appropriate
On occasion I’ll run into a lobby
to avoid greeting a friend
not because my mind vanishes
and I can’t remember his name
which is true but because I
must flee what is darkest in me
In other words when evicted from
a strange lobby into a stranger street
where every scaffold is full
and bodies dangle in the long
blue sorrow of the afternoon
without context explanation or sympathy
it’s good to know even momentarily
how to live among the relevant
the passionate and the confused"
Ernest M HemingwayThe Age Demanded"The age demanded that we sing
And cut away our tongue

The age demanded that we flow
And hammered in the bung

The age demanded that we dance
And jammed us into iron pants

And in the end the age was handed
The sort of shit that it demanded"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""She slumps in the disabled bay
clutching a waffle-cotton gown
around a spreading paunch
shambling breasts
Why not say ‘I’
For that’s who sits at  am
waiting for the health club
pool to open in the rain
A grown woman after all
supposed to know her whereabouts

Today’s my mother’s birthday
a  Aquarian of the self-
denying kind ‘never say “I”’ her motto
She had me nailed for years Her voice
drowns out the radio’s chattering static
Now I’m the same age she was dying
observing noble savagery

a gathering knot of skinny women
tight black butts in leotards
regulation sneakers Brazil-waxed calves
gripping i-pods mobiles water bottles
The men stand back silent sullen
balding bored and out of it Health stalkers
renouncers of smoke and flame
deniers of brimstone
One hell of a century
between the holocaust and the atom bomb
who are these people

Between the deep and shallow end
never say thank you or good morning
Avoid eye contact

Slow Lane Fast Lane Walking Lane
Only’s where I’m at
The moving parts count laps
twenty five’s a half-hour’s worth
I sing myself a rumba to keep rhythm
the Speedo wall clock ticks a strict /
defeats my ruse while dove’s feet skitter
arrow-wise across the perspex roof
No Diving Running Eating Smiling
Share if lanes are busy
Perhaps perhaps perhaps

The waiting crowd are all like me
up early talking or silent
more vivacious than galahs
more foolish than parrots

We stand and wait walk up and down
in the rain talking or not holding
in sagging muscle spreading paunch
talking about things that must matter
So much seems to hang on

James ScrutonThe Age of Dinosaurs"There are of course theories
about the wide-eyed drop-jawed
fascination children have for them
about how before hes learned
his own phone number or address
a five-year-old can carry
like a few small stones
the Latin tonnage of those names
the prefixes and preferences
for leaf or meat

My son recites the syllables
I stumble over now
sets up figures as I did
years ago in his prehistory
Here is the green ski slope
of a brontosaurs back
there a triceratops in full
gladiator gear From the arm
of a chair a pterodactyl
surveys the dark primeval carpet

Each has disappeared from time
to time excavated finally
from beneath a cabinet
or the sofa cushions only
to be buried again among its kind
in the deep toy chest
the closed lid snug as earth
The next time theyre brought out
to roam the living room
another bones been found

somewhere a tooth or fragment
of an eggshell dusted off
brushing away some long-held notion
about their life-span
or intelligence warm blood
or cold On the floor
they face off as if debating
the latest find what part
of which one of them
has been discovered this time

Or else they stand abreast
in one long row side
by scaly side waiting to fall
like dominoes my sons
tossed tennis ball a neon yellow
asteroid his shadow a dark cloud
when he stands his fervor for them
cooling so slowly he cant feel it—
the speed of glaciers maybe

Joyce Carol OatesAn Age of Miracles"He walked to the window
stared down twenty stories to the street
gaseous and dizzy as a swamp
not visible at this height
but there had been a street down there
and he knew

It came with the apartment
and the guarded foyers and halls
and the doorman
holstered
beneath the uniform
the television split-screening
front and rear entrances

He knew it was all there
and he was here twenty stories above
the unsetteled swamp-mist
he knew the trucks bound for the bridge
were still passing near
he could feel them rumbling
in the soles of his feet
so he knew

the floor he walked on
was someones ceiling
and it was all normal tonight
and countable
a two-year lease because
a desirable
with full view of
river-
a five-by-three balcony through the door is
$ deposit
fully carpeted
self-defrosting refriger-
the balcony door is stuck but
He can stare twenty stories down
from the windowsill
watching the swamp smokes curl and thin
and the swamp lapping at the base
and the unpaid-for miracle
one inch at a time"
"Second Baron Vaux of Harrowden Thomas Lord Vaux"The Aged Lover Renounceth Love"I loathe that I did love
In youth that I thought sweet
As time requires for my behove
Methinks they are not meet

My lusts they do me leave
My fancies all be fled
And tract of time begins to weave
Grey hairs upon my head

For age with stealing steps
Hath clawed me with his crutch
And lusty life away she leaps
As there had been none such

My Muse doth not delight
Me as she did before
My hand and pen are not in plight
As they have been of yore

For reason me denies
This youthly idle rhyme
And day by day to me she cries
“Leave off these toys in time”

The wrinkles in my brow
The furrows in my face
Say limping age will lodge him now
Where youth must give him place

The harbinger of death
To me I see him ride
The cough the cold the gasping breath
Doth bid me provide

A pickaxe and a spade
And eke a shrouding sheet
A house of clay for to be made
For such a guest most meet

Methinks I hear the clark
That knolls the careful knell
And bids me leave my woeful wark
Ere nature me compel

My keepers knit the knot
That youth did laugh to scorn
Of me that clean shall be forgot
As I had not been born

Thus must I youth give up
Whose badge I long did wear
To them I yield the wanton cup
That better may it bear

Lo here the barèd skull
By whose bald sign I know
That stooping age away shall pull
Which youthful years did sow

For beauty with her band
These crooked cares hath wrought
And shippèd me into the land
From whence I first was brought

And ye that bide behind
Have ye none other trust
As ye of clay were cast by kind
So shall ye waste to dust"
Teresa Mei ChucAgent Blue"To kill correctly

survival

Steven ToussaintAgnus Dei"After Denise Levertov
Must be a stumbler bleeder
as some floccus remains here carded
into ragged sleeves by barbed wire
I’d believe in a God who can learn

to work new spindles new pupils
uncomprehending the reasons
light rosins in winter and still
spill clumsily bleeding
Now drizzle caught

in oily pockets loads the fleece
with wealth I’ve often wondered
what the fence keeps out
in a country bereft of predators
I long ago reconciled

instinctive sympathy
for the perfect innocence of animals
with an equally ardent carnivory
Arms retreat guilt-free

through the widest breach
in the garment having chosen a meal
the stauncher faiths call impassible
withdrawing to empty folds
I hope you feel safe when you die"
Amiri BarakaAn Agony As Now"I am inside someone
who hates me I look
out from his eyes Smell
what fouled tunes come in
to his breath Love his
wretched women

Slits in the metal for sun Where
my eyes sit turning at the cool air
the glance of light or hard flesh
rubbed against me a woman a man
without shadow or voice or meaning

This is the enclosure flesh
where innocence is a weapon An
abstraction Touch Not mine
Or yours if you are the soul I had
and abandoned when I was blind and had
my enemies carry me as a dead man
if he is beautiful or pitied

It can be pain As now as all his
flesh hurts me It can be that Or
pain As when she ran from me into
that forest
Or pain the mind
silver spiraled whirled against the
sun higher than even old men thought
God would be Or pain And the other The
yes Inside his books his fingers They
are withered yellow flowers and were never
beautiful The yes You will lost soul say
‘beauty’ Beauty practiced as the tree The
slow river A white sun in its wet sentences

Or the cold men in their gale Ecstasy Flesh
or soul The yes Their robes blown Their bowls
empty They chant at my heels not at yours Flesh
or soul as corrupt Where the answer moves too quickly
Where the God is a self after all

Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes Flesh
white hot metal Glows as the day with its sun
It is a human love I live inside A bony skeleton
you recognize as words or simple feeling

But it has no feeling As the metal is hot it is not
given to love

It burns the thing
inside it And that thing
screams"
Peg BoyersAgony in the Garden"At supper he whispers something in your ear
the Judas boy who wants you

We go to the garden where it’s cool
and wait

From my place against the tree
I see you through the window

watch as you walk from door to desk
reach into your pocket

pull out your wallet empty it and leave it by the lamp
pick up a pen lean over to write then don’t

take something heavy from the drawer put it back
then sweep the money into a paper bag

You walk from desk to door and out your hand
reaching back to put out the light

On the security film you leave the building
alone holding the heavy bag

Off camera you walk towards the Charles leave
your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge

We wait in the garden
And wait

We don’t know yet whom you meet or why
We don’t know yet that the river has claimed you"
Linda PastanAgoraphobia"""Yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the marketplace
Hooting and shrieking""

—William Shakespeare


Imagine waking
to a scene of snow so new
not even memories
of other snow
can mar its silken
surface What other innocence
is quite like this
and who can blame me
for refusing
to violate such whiteness
with the booted cruelty
of tracks




Though I cannot leave this house
I have memorized the view
from every window—
 framed landscapes containing
each nuance of weather and light
And I know the measure
of every room not as a prisoner
pacing a cell
but as the embryo knows
the walls of the womb free
to swim as its body tells it to nudge
the softly fleshed walls
dreading only the moment
of contraction when it will be forced
into the gaudy world




Sometimes I travel as far
as the last stone
of the path but
every step
as in the childrens story
pricks that tender place
on the bottom of the foot
and like an ebbing tide with all
the obsession of the moon behind it
I am dragged back




I have noticed in windy fall
how leaves are torn from the trees
each leaf waving goodbye to the oak
or the poplar that housed it
how the moon pinned
to the very center of the window
is like a moth wanting only to break in
What I mean is this house
follows all the laws of lintel and ridgepole
obeys the commandments of broom
and of needle custom and grace
It is not fear that holds me here but passion
and the uncrossable moat of moonlight
outside the bolted doors"

Domitius gives her iron – a ring
Agrippina fingers it under her robes
while her hair is woven with flowers

gold placed on her neck and wrists
She thinks of the man older
than her father ever was

At the ceremony a pregnant sow is brought forward
dark and wreathed in leaves wine and crumbs
from holy cake are dusted on its brow

For the goddess Ceres for Terra Mater
for this marriage A man raises his ax
blunt-side down strikes the sow

slices the stunned animal’s throat opens
her belly The priest pushes fetal piglets aside
handles the entrails close to his eyes

looking for flaws Once signaled another man
places the insides on an altar for burning
Domitius watches Agrippina while the men

butcher the pig char the guts She does not look away
The priest steps into the blood face covered prays
in whispers a flute drowning out any ominous sounds"
Joy Harjo"Ah Ah""for Lurline McGregor
Ah ah cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina
Lands on the crown of the palm tree

Ah ah slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips
We carry canoes to the edge of the salt

Ah ah groans the crew with the weight the winds cutting skin
We claim our seats Pelicans perch in the draft for fish

Ah ah beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves
Though there are worlds below us and above us we are straight ahead

Ah ah tattoos the engines of your plane against the sky—away from these waters
Each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss

Ah ah calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale yellow sail We fly by
on our return over the net of eternity thrown out for stars

Ah ah scrapes the hull of my soul Ah ah"
Álvaro de Campos“Ah Margarida”"Ah Margarida
If I gave you my life
What would you do with it
I’d take my earrings out of hock
Marry a blind man
And live on a tree-lined block

But Margarida
If I gave you my life
What would your mother say
Her mother knows me inside out
She’d say you’re a fool
Without a doubt

And Margarida
If I gave you my life
Literally by dying
I’d go to your funeral firmly believing
You’d gone mad
To try to love by not living

But Margarida
If this giving of my life to you
Were merely poetry
In that case forget it

Because I don’t sell on credit

Queen Elizabeth I"Ah Silly Pug wert thou so Sore Afraid""Ah silly Pug wert thou so sore afraid
Mourn not my Wat nor be thou so dismayed
It passeth fickle Fortune’s power and skill
To force my heart to think thee any ill
No Fortune base thou sayest shall alter thee
And may so blind a witch so conquer me
No no my Pug though Fortune were not blind
Assure thyself she could not rule my mind
Fortune I know sometimes doth conquer kings
And rules and reigns on earth and earthly things
But never think Fortune can bear the sway
If virtue watch and will her not obey
Ne chose I thee by fickle Fortune’s rede
Ne she shall force me alter with such speed
But if to try this mistress’ jest with thee
Pull up thy heart suppress thy brackish tears
Torment thee not but put away thy fears
Dead to all joys and living unto woe
Slain quite by her that ne’er gave wise men blow
Revive again and live without all dread
The less afraid the better thou shalt speed"
William BlakeAh Sun-flower"Ah Sun-flower weary of time
Who countest the steps of the Sun
Seeking after that sweet golden clime
Where the travellers journey is done

Where the Youth pined away with desire
And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow
Arise from their graves and aspire
Where my Sun-flower wishes to go"
Franco FortiniAh the Delight   "Ah the delight of dawn
Over the grassy lawn
the spark of silk of silk
spat out by some small spider
to be the breezes pawn

A distant siren whines
from the freeway Sun shines
What a Sunday what peace
An old mans tidy peace
his favorite hour of all

The ants march on in rows
Theyre off to do who knows
what harm to the ripe pears 
Such sun now on the wall
The lizards heed its call"
Emily Brontë"Ah Why Because the Dazzling Sun""Ah why because the dazzling sun
Restored my earth to joy
Have you departed every one
And left a desert sky

All through the night your glorious eyes
Were gazing down in mine
And with a full hearts thankful sighs
I blessed that watch divine

I was at peace and drank your beams
As they were life to me
And revelled in my changeful dreams
Like petrel on the sea

Thought followed thought—star followed star
Through boundless regions on
While one sweet influence near and far
Thrilled through and proved us one

Why did the morning rise to break
So great so pure a spell
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek
Where your cool radiance fell

Blood-red he rose and arrow-straight
His fierce beams struck my brow
The soul of Nature sprang elate
But mine sank sad and low

My lids closed down—yet through their veil
I saw him blazing still
And bathe in gold the misty dale
And flash upon the hill

I turned me to the pillow then
To call back Night and see
Your worlds of solemn light again
Throb with my heart and me

It would not do—the pillow glowed
And glowed both roof and floor
And birds sang loudly in the wood
And fresh winds shook the door

The curtains waved the wakened flies
Were murmuring round my room
Imprisoned there till I should rise
And give them leave to roam

O Stars and Dreams and Gentle Night
O Night and Stars return
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm but burn—

That drains the blood of suffering men
Drinks tears instead of dew
Let me sleep through his blinding reign
And only wake with you"

Don BogenAir"Air as lost time
Voice of a cloud of a ghost crowned with nimbus
Smack-thin it lingers forty years

Everything stuffed urgent glittering alive
But it was just pleasure blank and sure
Now what is there to sing
From speakers the tune folds and fades in waves
Earphones drive it through your head"
John DonneAir and Angels"Twice or thrice had I lovd thee
Before I knew thy face or name
So in a voice so in a shapeless flame
Angels affect us oft and worshippd be
Still when to where thou wert I came
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see
But since my soul whose child love is
Takes limbs of flesh and else could nothing do
More subtle than the parent is
Love must not be but take a body too
And therefore what thou wert and who
I bid Love ask and now
That it assume thy body I allow
And fix itself in thy lip eye and brow

Whilst thus to ballast love I thought
And so more steadily to have gone
With wares which would sink admiration
I saw I had loves pinnace overfraught
Evry thy hair for love to work upon
Is much too much some fitter must be sought
For nor in nothing nor in things
Extreme and scattring bright can love inhere
Then as an angel face and wings
Of air not pure as it yet pure doth wear
So thy love may be my loves sphere
Just such disparity
As is twixt air and angels purity
Twixt womens love and mens will ever be"

Hart CraneThe Air Plant"Grand Cayman
This tuft that thrives on saline nothingness
Inverted octopus with heavenward arms
Thrust parching from a palm-bole hard by the cove⎯
A bird almost⎯of almost bird alarms

Is pulmonary to the wind that jars
Its tentacles horrific in their lurch
The lizard’s throat held bloated for a fly
Balloons but warily from this throbbing perch

The needles and hack-saws of cactus bleed
A milk of earth when stricken off the stalk
But this⎯defenseless thornless sheds no blood
Almost no shadow⎯but the air’s thin talk

Marge PiercyThe Air Smelled Dirty"Everyone burned coal in our neighborhood
soft coal they called it from the mountains
of western Pennsylvania where my father
grew up and fled as soon as he could where
my Welsh cousins dug it down in the dark

The furnace it fed stood in the dank
basement its many arms upraised
like Godzilla or some other monster
It was my job to pull out clinkers
and carry them to the alley bin

Mornings were chilly frost on windows
etching magic landscapes I liked
to stand over the hot air registers
the warmth blowing up my skirts
But the basement scared me at night

The fire glowed like a red eye through
the furnace door and the clinkers fell
loud and the shadows came at me as
mice scampered The washing machine
was tame but the furnace was always hungry"

Caitríona OReillyThe Airship Era"They’d barely emerged from the deep-green forests
of that epauletted century Geraniums bloomed on windowsills in Heidelberg
Student princes eyed the tavern keeper’s daughter through the blond foam
of their tankards The future must have seemed weightless
as it came nosing through the clouds smooth as a biblical fish
throwing its giant shadow on the sea floor its thin gold-beater’s skin
pressed back against its ribs cloche-hatted women in fox furs
waving through its observation windows Composed of too much

dream stuff to be echt matériel shoals of them congregated silently
over London in the moon’s dark phases concealed above clouds
Their crews were unnerved by crackling blue halos eerie lightning
shot from frostbitten fingers as they lowered spy baskets
on trapeze wires below the cloud cover taking careful soundings
then dropped their antique payloads on the gaping population
Those whom they did not kill scarcely believed in them
improbable contraptions the parchment-yellow color of old maps

vessels a rational traveler might have chosen a half-century earlier
to pursue daft round-the-world steampunk wagers But for them —

unfolding endlessly in signs and wonders over which they drifted

And up there everything looked different
the borders absurd the people in their witch-fearing villages as out-of-date
as peasants in a medieval breviary The mountains too seemed surpassable

offering an alternative angle on the sublime Occasionally there was concern
a tear in the fabric hooked to a typhoon’s tail above the China Sea
or harried by storms across the Atlantic But how lighter than air they were
They did not understand as they fell continually upwards
how the nature of the element was the price of their rising
the assiduous atom seeking an exit thronging the fabric of their cells

Stevie SmithThe Airy Christ"After reading Dr Rieu’s translation of St Mark’s Gospel
Who is this that comes in splendour coming from the blazing East
This is he we had not thought of this is he the airy Christ

Airy in an airy manner in an airy parkland walking
Others take him by the hand lead him do the talking

But the Form the airy One frowns an airy frown
What they say he knows must be but he looks aloofly down

Looks aloofly at his feet looks aloofly at his hands
Knows they must as prophets say nailèd be to wooden bands

As he knows the words he sings that he sings so happily
Must be changed to working laws yet sings he ceaselessly

Those who truly hear the voice the words the happy song
Never shall need working laws to keep from doing wrong

Deaf men will pretend sometimes they hear the song the words
And make excuse to sin extremely this will be absurd

Heed it not Whatever foolish men may do the song is cried
For those who hear and the sweet singer does not care that he was crucified

For he does not wish that men should love him more than anything
Because he died he only wishes they would hear him sing"
James Shirley"from
  
  Ajax Dirge""The glories of our blood and state
Are shadows not substantial things
There is no armor against fate
Death lays his icy hand on kings
Scepter and crown
Must tumble down
And in the dust be equal made
With the poor crooked scythe and spade

Some men with swords may reap the field
And plant fresh laurels where they kill
But their strong nerves at last must yield
They tame but one another still
Early or late
They stoop to fate
And must give up their murmuring breath
When they pale captives creep to death

The garlands wither on your brow
Then boast no more your mighty deeds
Upon death’s purple altar now
See where the victor-victim bleeds
Your heads must come
To the cold tomb
Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust"
Franz WrightAkechi’s Wife"On one occasion Yūgen of Ise Province was offering to share for a night or two the comforts of his home with me when a distant bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day then to a degree I would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice So worn out not even sure I was on the right road I forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire But I am so tired I heard my own voice say one of them that startlingly cruel intrusive voice I hate darkening everything how sick I am of listening to it and of having to go on But after some time had passed once again I forgot all about it as I sat there the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or perhaps a hidden joy of my own one I had so long considered extinct When Yūgen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking renga competitions and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again I think of her sometimes

   Launch Audio in a New Window""THE WAY OUT

The night is covered with signs The body and face of man
with signs and his journeys Where the rock is split
and speaks to the water the flame speaks to the cloud
the red splatter abstraction on the door
speaks to the angel and the constellations
The grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon
And the loud hammering of the land behind
speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs the hoofs
we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea

All night down the centuries have heard music of passage

Music of one child carried into the desert
firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid
Drawn through the water with the water-drawn people
led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain
The voice of the world speaking the world covered by signs
the burning the loving the speaking the opening
Strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain
Still flame the spoken singing of a young child
The meaning beginning to move which is the song

Music of those who have walked out of slavery

Into that journey where all things speak to all things
refusing to accept the curse and taking
for signs the signs of all things the world the body
which is part of the soul and speaks to the world
all creation being created in one image creation
This is not the past walking into the future
the walk is painful into the present the dance
not visible as dance until much later
These dancers are discoverers of God

We knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song

Out of a life of building lack on lack
the slaves refusing slavery escaping into faith
an army who came to the ocean the walkers
who walked through the opposites from I to opened Thou
city and cleave of the sea Those at flaming Nauvoo
the ice on the great river the escaping Negroes
swamp and wild city the shivering children of Paris
and the glass black hearses those on the Long March
all those who together are the frontier forehead of man

Where the wilderness enters the world the song of the world

Akiba rescued secretly in the clothes of death
by his disciples carried from Jerusalem
in blackness journeying to find his journey
to whatever he was loving with his life
The wilderness journey through which we move
under the whirlwind truth into the new
the only accurate A cluster of lights at night
faces before the pillar of fire A child watching
while the sea breaks open This night The way in

Barbarian music a new song

Acknowledging opened water possibility
open like a woman to this meaning
In a time of building statues of the stars
valuing certain partial ferocious skills
while past us the chill and immense wilderness
spreads its one-color wings until we know
rock water flame cloud or the floor of the sea
the world is a sign a way of speaking To find
What shall we find Energies rhythms journey

Ways to discover The song of the way in"

Jack Agüeros"Alan American Dreamer""Alan drives a cab at night
Has cab driver’s elbow
In his left arm
Sells real estate by day

Alan dreams of a big deal
Of opening a classy poolhall
Has a four million dollar deal
Which will probably fall through
Has a big land deal with the Post Office
But it will take  years to deliver
Because they are so slow

Alan collects baseball cards and comic books
Hates condos and townhouses
Though he lives in one
Was a trader for nineteen and one-half years
Then fired when the market melted

Alan even if he was rich
Would not let his stepdaughter
By his second wife
Have her own phone and private line
Like her rich friend Rebecca has
Because after all she is only twelve

Alan half Jewish has three tattoos
“I got them recently because I wanted them
My Jewish aunt nearly had a stroke
When she saw them”

Alan admits he is a pack rat saving
Everything loves wood restoration and antiques
Alan admires the people who buy old houses
And fix them up
Hates the development of Staten Island
Blaming it on the people from Brooklyn

Alan was cooking sausages and onions
His other half is Italian
In his back yard
When a woman knocked his parked car
Into the next block
Totaled it he got $ more
Than it was worth

Alan found a turtle and put
It in a safe stream
Stopped a dog from killing a cock
In historic Richmondtown

Alan hates the dump—
ninety-four percent of the garbage there
Is dropped by the other boroughs—
Likes the idea of secession
Staten Island free and independent

Alan apologetically asks
If he didn’t talk too much
As he brings me to my destination

He leaves me a great silence
And I wish I had one million American bucks
To tip the exuberant Alan

Alan take this million bucks
Strip the paint off the good wood of your dreams
And tattoo the tedious days"
Léonie Adams"Alas Kind Element""Then I was sealed and like the wintering tree
I stood me locked upon a summer core
Living had died a death and asked no more
And I lived then but as enduringly
And my heart beat but only as to be
Ill weathers well hail gust and cold I bore
I held my life as hid at root in store
Thus I lived then till this air breathed on me
Till this kind air breathed kindness everywhere
There where my times had left me I would stay
Then I was staunch I knew nor yes nor no
But now the wishful leaves have thronged the air
My every leaf leans forth upon the day
Alas kind element which comes to go"

Another kiss shall have my life ended
For to my mouth the first my heart did suck
The next shall clean out of my breast it pluck"

Calm is the sea the waves work less and less
So am not I whom love alas doth wring
Bringing before my face the great increase
Of my desires whereat I weep and sing
In joy and woe as in a doubtful case
For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring
But by and by the cause of my disease
Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting
When that I think what grief it is again
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain"

Percy sshe Shelley"Alastor or The Spirit of Solitude""Nondum amabam et amare amabam quaerebam quid amarem amans amare—
Confess St August
Earth ocean air belovèd brotherhood
If our great Mother has imbued my soul
With aught of natural piety to feel
Your love and recompense the boon with mine
If dewy morn and odorous noon and even
With sunset and its gorgeous ministers
And solemn midnights tingling silentness
If autumns hollow sighs in the sere wood
And winter robing with pure snow and crowns
Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs
If springs voluptuous pantings when she breathes
Her first sweet kisses have been dear to me
If no bright bird insect or gentle beast
I consciously have injured but still loved
And cherished these my kindred then forgive
This boast belovèd brethren and withdraw
No portion of your wonted favour now

Mother of this unfathomable world
Favour my solemn song for I have loved
Thee ever and thee only I have watched
Thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps
And my heart ever gazes on the depth
Of thy deep mysteries I have made my bed
In charnels and on coffins where black death
Keeps record of the trophies won from thee
Hoping to still these obstinate questionings
Of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost
Thy messenger to render up the tale
Of what we are In lone and silent hours
When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness
Like an inspired and desperate alchymist
Staking his very life on some dark hope
Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks
With my most innocent love until strange tears
Uniting with those breathless kisses made
Such magic as compels the charmèd night
To render up thy chargeand though neer yet
Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary
Enough from incommunicable dream
And twilight phantasms and deep noon-day thought
Has shone within me that serenely now
And moveless as a long-forgotten lyre
Suspended in the solitary dome
Of some mysterious and deserted fane
I wait thy breath Great Parent that my strain
May modulate with murmurs of the air
And motions of the forests and the sea
And voice of living beings and woven hymns
Of night and day and the deep heart of man

There was a Poet whose untimely tomb
No human hands with pious reverence reared
But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds
Built oer his mouldering bones a pyramid
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness—
A lovely youth—no mourning maiden decked
With weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath
The lone couch of his everlasting sleep—
Gentle and brave and generous—no lorn bard
Breathed oer his dark fate one melodious sigh
He lived he died he sung in solitude
Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes
And virgins as unknown he passed have pined
And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes
The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn
And Silence too enamoured of that voice
Locks its mute music in her rugged cell

By solemn vision and bright silver dream
His infancy was nurtured Every sight
And sound from the vast earth and ambient air
Sent to his heart its choicest impulses
The fountains of divine philosophy
Fled not his thirsting lips and all of great
Or good or lovely which the sacred past
In truth or fable consecrates he felt
And knew When early youth had past he left
His cold fireside and alienated home
To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands
Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness
Has lured his fearless steps and he has bought
With his sweet voice and eyes from savage men
His rest and food Natures most secret steps
He like her shadow has pursued whereer
The red volcano overcanopies
Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice
With burning smoke or where bitumen lakes
On black bare pointed islets ever beat
With sluggish surge or where the secret caves
Rugged and dark winding among the springs
Of fire and poison inaccessible
To avarice or pride their starry domes
Of diamond and of gold expand above
Numberless and immeasurable halls
Frequent with crystal column and clear shrines
Of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite
Nor had that scene of ampler majesty
Than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven
And the green earth lost in his heart its claims
To love and wonder he would linger long
In lonesome vales making the wild his home
Until the doves and squirrels would partake
From his innocuous hand his bloodless food
Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks
And the wild antelope that starts wheneer
The dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend
Her timid steps to gaze upon a form
More graceful than her own

His wandering step
Obedient to high thoughts has visited
The awful ruins of the days of old
Athens and Tyre and Balbec and the waste
Where stood Jerusalem the fallen towers
Of Babylon the eternal pyramids
Memphis and Thebes and whatsoeer of strange
Sculptured on alabaster obelisk
Or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx
Dark Æthiopia in her desert hills
Conceals Among the ruined temples there
Stupendous columns and wild images
Of more than man where marble daemons watch
The Zodiacs brazen mystery and dead men
Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around
He lingered poring on memorials
Of the worlds youth through the long burning day
Gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon
Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades
Suspended he that task but ever gazed
And gazed till meaning on his vacant mind
Flashed like strong inspiration and he saw
The thrilling secrets of the birth of time

Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food
Her daily portion from her fathers tent
And spread her matting for his couch and stole
From duties and repose to tend his steps—
Enamoured yet not daring for deep awe
To speak her love—and watched his nightly sleep
Sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips
Parted in slumber whence the regular breath
Of innocent dreams arose then when red morn
Made paler the pale moon to her cold home
Wildered and wan and panting she returned

The Poet wandering on through Arabie
And Persia and the wild Carmanian waste
And oer the aërial mountains which pour down
Indus and Oxus from their icy caves
In joy and exultation held his way
Till in the vale of Cashmire far within
Its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine
Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower
Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched
His languid limbs A vision on his sleep
There came a dream of hopes that never yet
Had flushed his cheek He dreamed a veilèd maid
Sate near him talking in low solemn tones
Her voice was like the voice of his own soul
Heard in the calm of thought its music long
Like woven sounds of streams and breezes held
His inmost sense suspended in its web
Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues
Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme
And lofty hopes of divine liberty
Thoughts the most dear to him and poesy
Herself a poet Soon the solemn mood
Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame
A permeating fire wild numbers then
She raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs
Subdued by its own pathos her fair hands
Were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp
Strange symphony and in their branching veins
The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale
The beating of her heart was heard to fill
The pauses of her music and her breath
Tumultuously accorded with those fits
Of intermitted song Sudden she rose
As if her heart impatiently endured
Its bursting burthen at the sound he turned
And saw by the warm light of their own life
Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil
Of woven wind her outspread arms now bare
Her dark locks floating in the breath of night
Her beamy bending eyes her parted lips
Outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly
His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess
Of love He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled
His gasping breath and spread his arms to meet
Her panting bosomshe drew back a while
Then yielding to the irresistible joy
With frantic gesture and short breathless cry
Folded his frame in her dissolving arms
Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night
Involved and swallowed up the vision sleep
Like a dark flood suspended in its course
Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain

Roused by the shock he started from his trance—
The cold white light of morning the blue moon
Low in the west the clear and garish hills
The distinct valley and the vacant woods
Spread round him where he stood Whither have fled
The hues of heaven that canopied his bower
Of yesternight The sounds that soothed his sleep
The mystery and the majesty of Earth
The joy the exultation His wan eyes
Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly
As oceans moon looks on the moon in heaven
The spirit of sweet human love has sent
A vision to the sleep of him who spurned
Her choicest gifts He eagerly pursues
Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade
He overleaps the bounds Alas Alas
Were limbs and breath and being intertwined
Thus treacherously Lost lost for ever lost
In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep
That beautiful shape Does the dark gate of death
Conduct to thy mysterious paradise
O Sleep Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds
And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake
Lead only to a black and watery depth
While deaths blue vault with loathliest vapours hung
Where every shade which the foul grave exhales
Hides its dead eye from the detested day
Conduct O Sleep to thy delightful realms
This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart
The insatiate hope which it awakened stung
His brain even like despair

While daylight held
The sky the Poet kept mute conference
With his still soul At night the passion came
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream
And shook him from his rest and led him forth
Into the darkness—As an eagle grasped
In folds of the green serpent feels her breast
Burn with the poison and precipitates
Through night and day tempest and calm and cloud
Frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight
Oer the wide aëry wilderness thus driven
By the bright shadow of that lovely dream
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells
Startling with careless step the moonlight snake
He fled Red morning dawned upon his flight
Shedding the mockery of its vital hues
Upon his cheek of death He wandered on
Till vast Aornos seen from Petras steep
Hung oer the low horizon like a cloud
Through Balk and where the desolated tombs
Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind
Their wasting dust wildly he wandered on
Day after day a weary waste of hours
Bearing within his life the brooding care
That ever fed on its decaying flame
And now his limbs were lean his scattered hair
Sered by the autumn of strange suffering
Sung dirges in the wind his listless hand
Hung like dead bone within its withered skin
Life and the lustre that consumed it shone
As in a furnace burning secretly
From his dark eyes alone The cottagers
Who ministered with human charity
His human wants beheld with wondering awe
Their fleeting visitant The mountaineer
Encountering on some dizzy precipice
That spectral form deemed that the Spirit of wind
With lightning eyes and eager breath and feet
Disturbing not the drifted snow had paused
In its career the infant would conceal
His troubled visage in his mothers robe
In terror at the glare of those wild eyes
To remember their strange light in many a dream
Of after-times but youthful maidens taught
By nature would interpret half the woe
That wasted him would call him with false names
Brother and friend would press his pallid hand
At parting and watch dim through tears the path
Of his departure from their fathers door

At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore
He paused a wide and melancholy waste
Of putrid marshes A strong impulse urged
His steps to the sea-shore A swan was there
Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds
It rose as he approached and with strong wings
Scaling the upward sky bent its bright course
High over the immeasurable main
His eyes pursued its flight—""Thou hast a home
Beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home
Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck
With thine and welcome thy return with eyes
Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy
And what am I that I should linger here
With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes
Spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned
To beauty wasting these surpassing powers
In the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven
That echoes not my thoughts"" A gloomy smile
Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips
For sleep he knew kept most relentlessly
Its precious charge and silent death exposed
Faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure
With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms

Startled by his own thoughts he looked around
There was no fair fiend near him not a sight
Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind
A little shallop floating near the shore
Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze
It had been long abandoned for its sides
Gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints
Swayed with the undulations of the tide
A restless impulse urged him to embark
And meet lone Death on the drear oceans waste
For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves
The slimy caverns of the populous deep

The day was fair and sunny sea and sky
Drank its inspiring radiance and the wind
Swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves
Following his eager soul the wanderer
Leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft
On the bare mast and took his lonely seat
And felt the boat speed oer the tranquil sea
Like a torn cloud before the hurricane

As one that in a silver vision floats
Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds
Upon resplendent clouds so rapidly
Along the dark and ruffled waters fled
The straining boat—A whirlwind swept it on
With fierce gusts and precipitating force
Through the white ridges of the chafèd sea
The waves arose Higher and higher still
Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempests scourge
Like serpents struggling in a vultures grasp
Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war
Of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast
Descending and black flood on whirlpool driven
With dark obliterating course he sate
As if their genii were the ministers
Appointed to conduct him to the light
Of those belovèd eyes the Poet sate
Holding the steady helm Evening came on
The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues
High mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray
That canopied his path oer the waste deep
Twilight ascending slowly from the east
Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks
Oer the fair front and radiant eyes of day
Night followed clad with stars On every side
More horribly the multitudinous streams
Of oceans mountainous waste to mutual war
Rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock
The calm and spangled sky The little boat
Still fled before the storm still fled like foam
Down the steep cataract of a wintry river
Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave
Now leaving far behind the bursting mass
That fell convulsing ocean Safely fled—
As if that frail and wasted human form
Had been an elemental god

At midnight
The moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs
Of Caucasus whose icy summits shone
Among the stars like sunlight and around
Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves
Bursting and eddying irresistibly
Rage and resound for ever—Who shall save—
The boat fled on—the boiling torrent drove—
The crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms
The shattered mountain overhung the sea
And faster still beyond all human speed
Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave
The little boat was driven A cavern there
Yawned and amid its slant and winding depths
Ingulfed the rushing sea The boat fled on
With unrelaxing speed—""Vision and Love""
The Poet cried aloud ""I have beheld
The path of thy departure Sleep and death
Shall not divide us long""

The boat pursued
The windings of the cavern Daylight shone
At length upon that gloomy rivers flow
Now where the fiercest war among the waves
Is calm on the unfathomable stream
The boat moved slowly Where the mountain riven
Exposed those black depths to the azure sky
Ere yet the floods enormous volume fell
Even to the base of Caucasus with sound
That shook the everlasting rocks the mass
Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm
Stair above stair the eddying waters rose
Circling immeasurably fast and laved
With alternating dash the gnarlèd roots
Of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms
In darkness over it I the midst was left
Reflecting yet distorting every cloud
A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm
Seized by the sway of the ascending stream
With dizzy swiftness round and round and round
Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose
Till on the verge of the extremest curve
Where through an opening of the rocky bank
The waters overflow and a smooth spot
Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides
Is left the boat paused shuddering—Shall it sink
Down the abyss Shall the reverting stress
Of that resistless gulf embosom it
Now shall it fall—A wandering stream of wind
Breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail
And lo with gentle motion between banks
Of mossy slope and on a placid stream
Beneath a woven grove it sails and hark
The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar
With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods
Where the embowering trees recede and leave
A little space of green expanse the cove
Is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers
For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes
Reflected in the crystal calm The wave
Of the boats motion marred their pensive task
Which nought but vagrant bird or wanton wind
Or falling spear-grass or their own decay
Had eer disturbed before The Poet longed
To deck with their bright hues his withered hair
But on his heart its solitude returned
And he forbore Not the strong impulse hid
In those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame
Had yet performed its ministry it hung
Upon his life as lightning in a cloud
Gleams hovering ere it vanish ere the floods
Of night close over it

The noonday sun
Now shone upon the forest one vast mass
Of mingling shade whose brown magnificence
A narrow vale embosoms There huge caves
Scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks
Mocking its moans respond and roar for ever
The meeting boughs and implicated leaves
Wove twilight oer the Poets path as led
By love or dream or god or mightier Death
He sought in Natures dearest haunt some bank
Her cradle and his sepulchre More dark
And dark the shades accumulate The oak
Expanding its immense and knotty arms
Embraces the light beech The pyramids
Of the tall cedar overarching frame
Most solemn domes within and far below
Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky
The ash and the acacia floating hang
Tremulous and pale Like restless serpents clothed
In rainbow and in fire the parasites
Starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around
The grey trunks and as gamesome infants eyes
With gentle meanings and most innocent wiles
Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love
These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs
Uniting their close union the woven leaves
Make net-work of the dark blue light of day
And the nights noontide clearness mutable
As shapes in the weird clouds Soft mossy lawns
Beneath these canopies extend their swells
Fragrant with perfumed herbs and eyed with blooms
Minute yet beautiful One darkest glen
Sends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine
A soul-dissolving odour to invite
To some more lovely mystery Through the dell
Silence and Twilight here twin-sisters keep
Their noonday watch and sail among the shades
Like vaporous shapes half seen beyond a well
Dark gleaming and of most translucent wave
Images all the woven boughs above
And each depending leaf and every speck
Of azure sky darting between their chasms
Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves
Its portraiture but some inconstant star
Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair
Or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon
Or gorgeous insect floating motionless
Unconscious of the day ere yet his wings
Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon

Hither the Poet came His eyes beheld
Their own wan light through the reflected lines
Of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth
Of that still fountain as the human heart
Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave
Sees its own treacherous likeness there He heard
The motion of the leaves the grass that sprung
Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel
An unaccustomed presence and the sound
Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs
Of that dark fountain rose A Spirit seemed
To stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes
Of shadowy silver or enshrining light
Borrowed from aught the visible world affords
Of grace or majesty or mystery—
But undulating woods and silent well
And leaping rivulet and evening gloom
Now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming
Held commune with him as if he and it
Were all that was—only when his regard
Was raised by intense pensiveness two eyes
Two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought
And seemed with their serene and azure smiles
To beckon him

Obedient to the light
That shone within his soul he went pursuing
The windings of the dell—The rivulet
Wanton and wild through many a green ravine
Beneath the forest flowed Sometimes it fell
Among the moss with hollow harmony
Dark and profound Now on the polished stones
It danced like childhood laughing as it went
Then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept
Reflecting every herb and drooping bud
That overhung its quietness—""O stream
Whose source is inaccessibly profound
Whither do thy mysterious waters tend
Thou imagest my life Thy darksome stillness
Thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs
Thy searchless fountain and invisible course
Have each their type in me and the wide sky
And measureless ocean may declare as soon
What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud
Contains thy waters as the universe
Tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched
Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste
I the passing wind""

Beside the grassy shore
Of the small stream he went he did impress
On the green moss his tremulous step that caught
Strong shuddering from his burning limbs As one
Roused by some joyous madness from the couch
Of fever he did move yet not like him
Forgetful of the grave where when the flame
Of his frail exultation shall be spent
He must descend With rapid steps he went
Beneath the shade of trees beside the flow
Of the wild babbling rivulet and now
The forests solemn canopies were changed
For the uniform and lightsome evening sky
Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed
The struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae
Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope
And nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines
Branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots
The unwilling soil A gradual change was here
Yet ghastly For as fast years flow away
The smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin
And white and where irradiate dewy eyes
Had shone gleam stony orbs—so from his steps
Bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade
Of the green groves with all their odorous winds
And musical motions Calm he still pursued
The stream that with a larger volume now
Rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there
Fretted a path through its descending curves
With its wintry speed On every side now rose
Rocks which in unimaginable forms
Lifted their black and barren pinnacles
In the light of evening and its precipice
Obscuring the ravine disclosed above
Mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves
Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues
To the loud stream Lo where the pass expands
Its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks
And seems with its accumulated crags
To overhang the world for wide expand
Beneath the wan stars and descending moon
Islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams
Dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom
Of leaden-coloured even and fiery hills
Mingling their flames with twilight on the verge
Of the remote horizon The near scene
In naked and severe simplicity
Made contrast with the universe A pine
Rock-rooted stretched athwart the vacancy
Its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast
Yielding one only response at each pause
In most familiar cadence with the howl
The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams
Mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river
Foaming and hurrying oer its rugged path
Fell into that immeasurable void
Scattering its waters to the passing winds

Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine
And torrent were not all—one silent nook
Was there Even on the edge of that vast mountain
Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks
It overlooked in its serenity
The dark earth and the bending vault of stars
It was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile
Even in the lap of horror Ivy clasped
The fissured stones with its entwining arms
And did embower with leaves for ever green
And berries dark the smooth and even space
Of its inviolated floor and here
The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore
In wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay
Red yellow or ethereally pale
Rivals the pride of summer Tis the haunt
Of every gentle wind whose breath can teach
The wilds to love tranquillity One step
One human step alone has ever broken
The stillness of its solitude—one voice
Alone inspired its echoes—even that voice
Which hither came floating among the winds
And led the loveliest among human forms
To make their wild haunts the depository
Of all the grace and beauty that endued
Its motions render up its majesty
Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm
And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould
Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss
Commit the colours of that varying cheek
That snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes

The dim and hornèd moon hung low and poured
A sea of lustre on the horizons verge
That overflowed its mountains Yellow mist
Filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank
Wan moonlight even to fulness not a star
Shone not a sound was heard the very winds
Dangers grim playmates on that precipice
Slept clasped in his embrace—O storm of death
Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night
And thou colossal Skeleton that still
Guiding its irresistible career
In thy devastating omnipotence
Art king of this frail world from the red field
Of slaughter from the reeking hospital
The patriots sacred couch the snowy bed
Of innocence the scaffold and the throne
A mighty voice invokes thee Ruin calls
His brother Death A rare and regal prey
He hath prepared prowling around the world
Glutted with which thou mayst repose and men
Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms
Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine
The unheeded tribute of a broken heart

When on the threshold of the green recess
The wanderers footsteps fell he knew that death
Was on him Yet a little ere it fled
Did he resign his high and holy soul
To images of the majestic past
That paused within his passive being now
Like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe
Through some dim latticed chamber He did place
His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk
Of the old pine Upon an ivied stone
Reclined his languid head his limbs did rest
Diffused and motionless on the smooth brink
Of that obscurest chasm—and thus he lay
Surrendering to their final impulses
The hovering powers of life Hope and despair
The torturers slept no mortal pain or fear
Marred his repose the influxes of sense
And his own being unalloyed by pain
Yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed
The stream of thought till he lay breathing there
At peace and faintly smiling—his last sight
Was the great moon which oer the western line
Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended
With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed
To mingle Now upon the jaggèd hills
It rests and still as the divided frame
Of the vast meteor sunk the Poets blood
That ever beat in mystic sympathy
With natures ebb and flow grew feebler still
And when two lessening points of light alone
Gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp
Of his faint respiration scarce did stir
The stagnate night—till the minutest ray
Was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart
It paused—it fluttered But when heaven remained
Utterly black the murky shades involved
An image silent cold and motionless
As their own voiceless earth and vacant air
Even as a vapour fed with golden beams
That ministered on sunlight ere the west
Eclipses it was now that wondrous frame—
No sense no motion no divinity—
A fragile lute on whose harmonious strings
The breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream
Once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream
Of youth which night and time have quenched for ever
Still dark and dry and unremembered now

O for Medeas wondrous alchemy
Which wheresoeer it fell made the earth gleam
With bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale
From vernal blooms fresh fragrance O that God
Profuse of poisons would concede the chalice
Which but one living man has drained who now
Vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels
No proud exemption in the blighting curse
He bears over the world wanders for ever
Lone as incarnate death O that the dream
Of dark magician in his visioned cave
Raking the cinders of a crucible
For life and power even when his feeble hand
Shakes in its last decay were the true law
Of this so lovely world But thou art fled
Like some frail exhalation which the dawn
Robes in its golden beams—ah thou hast fled
The brave the gentle and the beautiful
The child of grace and genius Heartless things
Are done and said i the world and many worms
And beasts and men live on and mighty Earth
From sea and mountain city and wilderness
In vesper low or joyous orison
Lifts still its solemn voice—but thou art fled—
Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes
Of this phantasmal scene who have to thee
Been purest ministers who are alas
Now thou art not Upon those pallid lips
So sweet even in their silence on those eyes
That image sleep in death upon that form
Yet safe from the worms outrage let no tear
Be shed—not even in thought Nor when those hues
Are gone and those divinest lineaments
Worn by the senseless wind shall live alone
In the frail pauses of this simple strain
Let not high verse mourning the memory
Of that which is no more or paintings woe
Or sculpture speak in feeble imagery
Their own cold powers Art and eloquence
And all the shows o the world are frail and vain
To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade
It is a woe too ""deep for tears"" when all
Is reft at once when some surpassing Spirit
Whose light adorned the world around it leaves
Those who remain behind not sobs or groans
The passionate tumult of a clinging hope
But pale despair and cold tranquillity
Natures vast frame the web of human things
Birth and the grave that are not as they were"
Kate BassThe Albatross"When I know you are coming home
I put on this necklace
glass beads on a silken thread
a blue that used to match my eyes
I like to think I am remembering you
I like to think you don’t forget

The necklace lies heavy on my skin
it clatters when I reach down
to lift my screaming child
I swing her roll her in my arms until she forgets
The beads glitter in the flicker of a TV set
as I sit her on my lap
and wish away the afternoon

I wait until I hear a gate latch lift
the turn of key in lock
I sit amongst toys and unwashed clothes
I sit and she fingers the beads until you speak
in a voice that no longer seems familiar only strange
I turn as our child tugs at the string
I hear a snap and a sound like falling rain"

Anne KilligrewAlexandreis"I sing the man that never equal knew
Whose mighty arms all Asia did subdue
Whose conquests through the spacious world do ring
That city-raser king-destroying king
Who o’er the warlike Macedons did reign
And worthily the name of Great did gain
This is the prince if fame you will believe
To ancient story any credit give
Who when the globe of Earth he had subdued
With tears the easy victory pursued
Because that no more worlds there were to win
No further scene to act his glories in

Ah that some pitying Muse would now inspire
My frozen style with a poetic fire
And raptures worthy of his matchless fame
Whose deeds I sing whose never fading name
Long as the world shall fresh and deathless last
No less to future ages then the past
Great my presumption is I must confess
But if I thrive my glory’s ne’er the less
Nor will it from his conquests derogate
A female pen his acts did celebrate
If thou O Muse wilt thy assistance give
Such as made Naso and great Maro live
With him whom Melas’ fertile banks did bear
Live though their bodies dust and ashes are
Whose laurels were not fresher than their fame
Is now and will for ever be the same
If the like favor thou wilt grant to me
O Queen of Verse I’ll not ungrateful be
My choicest hours to thee I’ll dedicate
’Tis thou shalt rule ’tis thou shalt be my fate
But if coy goddess thou shalt this deny
And from my humble suit disdaining fly
I’ll stoop and beg no more since I know this
Writing of him I cannot write amiss
His lofty deeds will raise each feeble line
And god-like acts will make my verse divine
’Twas at the time the golden sun doth rise
And with his beams enlights the azure skies
When lo a troop in silver arms drew near
The glorious sun did nere so bright appear
Dire scarlet plumes adorned their haughty crests
And crescent shields did shade their shining breasts
Down from their shoulders hung a panther’s hide
A bow and quiver rattled by their side
Their hands a knotty well tried spear did bear
Jocund they seemed and quite devoid of fear
These warlike virgins were that do reside
Near Thermodon’s smooth banks and verdant side
The plains of Themiscyre their birth do boast
Thalestris now did head the beauteous host
She emulating that illustrious dame
Who to the aid of Troy and Priam came
And her who the Retulian prince did aid
Though dearly both for their assistance paid
But fear she scorned nor the like fate did dread
Her host she often to the field had led
As oft in triumph had returned again
Glory she only sought for all her pain
This martial queen had heard how loudly fame
Echoed our conqueror’s redoubted name
Her soul his conduct and his courage fired
To see the hero she so much admired
And to Hyrcania for this cause she went
Where Alexander wholly then intent
On triumphs and such military sport
At truce with war held both his camp and court
And while before the town she did attend
Her messengers return she saw ascend
A cloud of dust that covered all the sky
And still at every pause there stroke her eye
The interrupted beams of burnished gold
As dust the splendor hid or did unfold
Loud neighings of the steeds and trumpets’ sound
Filled all the air and echoed from the ground
The gallant Greeks with a brisk march drew near
And their great chief did at their head appear
And now come up to th’Amazonian band
They made a halt and a respectful stand
And both the troops with like amazement strook
Did each on other with deep silence look
Th’heroic queen whose high pretence to war
Cancelled the bashful laws and nicer bar
Of modesty which did her sex restrain
First boldly did advance before her train
And thus she spake All but a god in name
And that a debt time owes unto thy fame

This was the first essay of this young lady in
poetry but finding the task she had undertaken
hard she laid it by till practice and more time
should make her equal to so great a work"
Rachel WetzsteonAlgonquin Afterthoughts"By the time you swear you’re his
Shivering and sighing
And he vows his passion is
Infinite undying—
Lady make a note of this
One of you is lying

—Dorothy Parker

Or else our drunken tumble was
too true for daylight’s pleasure
too much in vino veritas
troubled the gods of measure
who sent bright draughts of sunshine down
and sobered up my treasure

All night rapacity had come
as naturally as breathing
we nibbled on each other’s necks
like greedy babies teething
How soon an empty bottle makes
one feel a blissful free thing

“Aspirin aspirin” he implored
I fed him several pills
and when he wondered where he was
it gave me frightful chills
but still I told him of the party’s
unexpected thrills

Words woke us up reflection turned
affection to regret
“After she left me I tried not
to do this but I get
so lonely”so I showed him out
warbling “I’m glad we met”

But now I crave the swift return
of scotch-transfigured nights
like Chaplin horrified by his
rich friend in City Lights
who only recognizes him
from liquor-gladdened heights

sticking a tall glass in the man’s
upstanding hand the clink
or worse awaits poor tramps like us
if scamps like you won’t think
and meekly scolding in a voice
weak with nostalgia “Drink”"
Carol FrostAlias City"They were travelers plotting river courses
writing the genesis of unknown people
fugitives with a revolver in one hand reins in another
merchants among the olive trees euphorbias mimosas
emissaries deserters Some knew the native tongues
they called themselves by new names
in the eastern twilight different parts of their soul
never having learned to live together
Skies burned Dust covered the palms
and minarets as they arrived by the incandescent shore
of our city each with his own little dreams and disasters
Some remained never to be heard of again
Some left with caravans wearing native dress — ephemerids
Where are they What are they used to
The only preserved interview — concerning an artist and explorer

Did he ever speak of his friends in X
Never The only thing he liked in X was his sister
But did you know that he painted
Oh yes — some fine things stemware
a series of watercolors of shoebills and Abdim’s stork"

Barbara RasAll"The prisoner can’t go any longer but he does
The beggar can’t go on begging but watch—
Tomorrow he’ll be in the alley holding out a bowl
To everyone to even a young possibly poorer child
The mother can’t go on believing
But she will kneel for hours in the cathedral
Holding silence in her arms
The rain goes on daily sometimes and we cry
As often as not alone
The fishmonger the bell ringer the cook each
Can be corrupted in a less than dire way
Nothing can replace the sea breezes you were born to
Nothing can stay the shy ache in the palm
you hold out to the fortune-teller
The concrete lions on her steps go on
Making bloodless journeys they go on
Hunting in air longer than any of you will live to watch
Hunting still after your futures become all irises
and blamelessness"
David HernandezAll-American"I’m this tiny this statuesque and everywhere

Both boxes Bi not bi who cares stop

of crab walking for hours across a lettuce field

so someone could order the Caesar salad

No one dreams of sliding a squeegee down

Some of us cut hair Some of us carefully

steer a mower around the cemetery grounds

Some of us paint houses Some of us monitor

rolling clamorous and glittering backbone"
Ed RobersonAll at Once"Trees have whole streets
of when they were planted
plaqued with when the city is
to inherit them dead
of age almost all at once as if
a natural bombing


People see a bill not figured in
a blood red
collection come
like fall’s leaf
due without fail
an unseen cost of the design
pale bud and yellow blossom—


though seeming little to do this time
with tense spring
in the window
of dead and dying trees’ terms up
with expecting a life by life replacement—
not this plague of life’s time


as a season across the city
By trial we do but don’t
know how death counts the rings
from trees to clocks
species to singled soul
at its hour or on history’s days we all die at once"
Christian WimanAll Good Conductors"I


O the screech and heat and hate
we have for each days commute

the long wait at the last stop
before we go screaming

underground while the pigeons
court and shit and rut

insolently on the tracks
because this train is always late

always aimed at only us
who when it comes with its

blunt snout its thousand mouths
cram and curse and contort

into one creature all claws and eyes
tunneling tunneling tunneling

toward money



Sometimes a beauty
cools through the doors at Grand

glides all the untouchable
angles and planes

of herself
to stand among us

like a little skyscraper
so sheer so spare

gazes going all over her
in a craving wincing way

like sun on glass



There is a dreamer
all good conductors

know to look for
when the last stop is made

and the train is ticking cool
some lover loner or fool

who has lived so hard
he jerks awake

in the graveyard
where he sees

coming down the aisle
a beam of light

whose end he is
and what he thinks are chains

becoming keys"
Louise GlückAll Hallows"Even now this landscape is assembling
The hills darken The oxen
sleep in their blue yoke
the fields having been
picked clean the sheaves
bound evenly and piled at the roadside
among cinquefoil as the toothed moon rises

This is the barrenness
of harvest or pestilence
And the wife leaning out the window
with her hand extended as in payment
and the seeds
distinct gold calling
Come here
Come here little one"
Dorothea TanningAll Hallows’ Eve"Be perfect make it otherwise
Yesterday is torn in shreds
Lightning’s thousand sulfur eyes
Rip apart the breathing beds
Hear bones crack and pulverize
Doom creeps in on rubber treads
Countless overwrought housewives
Minds unraveling like threads
Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
Fears of age and general dreads
Sit tight be perfect swat the spies
Don’t take faucets for fountainheads
Drink tasty antidotes Otherwise
You and the werewolf newlyweds"
Sabrina Orah MarkAll Is Fair in Love and War"“Who is Beatrice” wondered Walter B “to give Beatrice up her hope” Beatrice sulked under her cauliflower-colored hat “It is like” said Beatrice “I can barely crack another joke” “This is correct” said Walter B “It is most certainly like that Nevertheless whoever you are it is not up to you to give up your hope And additionally you are spoiling the day” “What is ‘giving up your hope’” asked Beatrice “It is when” explained Walter B “you have to ask”



It all began with the appearance of The Unlikelies It was difficult to anticipate in these small men sitting cross-legged on the living room floor the havoc they would bring They held hands They sang a song about trees and as they sang their tree-shaped ears swelled with what Beatrice would later describe as pride They asked for gently steamed vegetables They seemed genuinely concerned “Pick a heart” they cheered “any heart” Beatrice picked one “Expect for that one” Beatrice picked another “And that one too” “That was less joyous” said Beatrice “than I’d expected” “The hearts you picked” explained The Unlikelies “had been picked yesterday” “It is unlikely” said The Unlikelies “that will happen again” Walter B hid in the kitchen Whose side The Unlikelies were on Beatrice began to wonder “Pick a heart” they urged Beatrice picked another “Except for that one” Beatrice picked another “And that one too” With each heart Beatrice picked The Unlikelies grew larger They seemed genuinely concerned “All is dare” they reminded Beatrice with their mouths full of broccoli and carrots and peas “in blur and core” By dawn Walter B could still hear Beatrice picking hearts Their empty husks filled the floor The Unlikelies huddled closer together “Except for that one” they mumbled sleepily moving closer to the door The Unlikelies were by now as big as the furniture “And that one too” Walter B hid in the kitchen He imagined he would make out of all the husks a hearty soup He rummaged for a pot He would feed Beatrice the soup drop by drop until she forgot this highly unlikely event impossible to forsee by any hopeful thing “All is spare in buds and more” promised The Unlikelies as they squeezed their enormous bodies out the door



Days later when Beatrice asked Walter B if The Unlikelies were still standing outside in the sunlight congratulating each other Walter B said “no” But Beatrice knew they were there And she knew they would return for her They seemed genuinely concerned"

Alejandra PizarnikAll night I hear the noise of water sobbing"All night I hear the noise of water sobbing All night I make night in me I make the day that begins on my account that sobs because day falls like water through night
All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling All night I write luminous messages messages of rain all night someone checks for me and I check for someone
The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia Steps of someone who no longer writhes who no longer writes All night someone holds back then crosses the circle of bitter light
All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence All night I see something lurch toward my looking something humid contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing
Absence blows grayly and night goes dense Night the shade of the eyelids of the dead viscous night exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth without cold All night I flee from someone I lead the chase I lead the fugue I sing a song of mourning Black birds over black shrouds My brain cries Demented wind I leave the tense and strained hand I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing this clatter in the night this delay this infamy this pursuit this inexistence
All night I see that abandonment is me that the sole sobbing voice is me We can search with lanterns cross the shadow’s lie We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart
All night I ask you why All night you tell me no"

Since Yorkshire hills are green –
Yet not in all the nests I meet –

Michael CollierAll Souls"A few of us—Hillary Clinton Vlad Dracula
Oprah Winfrey and Trotsky—peer through
the kitchen window at a raccoon perched
outside on a picnic table where it picks

over chips veggies olives and a chunk of pâte
Behind us others crowd the hallway many more
dance in the living room Trotsky fusses with the bloody
screwdriver puttied to her forehead

Hillary Clinton whose voice is the rumble
of a bowling ball whose hands are hairy
to the third knuckle lifts his rubber chin to announce
“What a perfect mask it has” While the Count

whistling through his plastic fangs says “Oh
and a nose like a chef” Then one by one
the other masks join in “Tail of a gambler”
“a swashbuckler’s hips” “feet of a cat burglar”

Trotsky scratches herself beneath her skirt
and Hillary whose lederhosen are so tight they form a codpiece
wraps his legs around Trotsky’s leg and humps like a dog
Dracula and Oprah the married hosts hold hands

and then let go Meanwhile the raccoon squats on
the gherkins extracts pimentos from olives and sniffs
abandoned cups of beer A ghoul in the living room
turns the music up and the house becomes a drum

The windows buzz “Who do you love Who do you love”
the singer sings Our feathered arms our stockinged legs
The intricate paws the filleting tongue
We love what we are we love what we’ve become"
Carol FrostAll Summer Long"The dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch
A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree
like a cry in the throat The sky is clay for the child who is past
being tired who wanders in waist-deep
grasses Gnats rise in a vapor
in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears

The sun is an indistinct moon Frail sticks
of grass poke her ankles
and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs
like wet fingers The musk and smell
of air are as hot as the savory
terrible exhales from a tired horse

The parents are sleeping all afternoon
and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons
She hears their combined breathing and swallowing
salivas and sees their sides rising and falling
like the sides of horses in the hot pasture

At evening a breeze dries and crumbles
the sky and the clouds float like undershirts
and cotton dresses on a clothesline Horses
rock to their feet and race or graze
Parents open their shutters and call
the lonely happy child home
The child who hates silences talks and talks
of cicadas and the manes of horses"
Cornelius EadyAll the American Poets Have Titled Their New Books “The End”"How many books now have the word Last
In their title Or worry or some dangling variation
Of mistake Or empire burning or
The fools have fucked it up

Who the hell listens They roar and
Wriggle up and down the page
They screen-print what’s coming next — pinups
Of blocked streets and stone faces

How many books sling the word doom
Or mimic spotlights or air raid sirens
Regurgitate the Romans the Kick Down the
Door Guys our genius with the fiery furnace

The quivers the shakes the iambic dread
The anger the insomnia the slow tic
Of the wait the wail the transcribed too late
In the manner of those who have gone before us
Geiger counters clacking the rising damp"

Christopher SotoAll the Dead Boys Look Like Me"Last time I saw myself die is when police killed Jessie Hernandez

A  year old brown queer // who was sleeping in their car

Yesterday I saw myself die again // Fifty times I died in Orlando // amp

I remember reading // Dr José Esteban Muñoz before he passed

I was studying at NYU // where he was teaching // where he wrote shit

That made me feel like a queer brown survival was possible // But he didn’t

Survive amp now // on the dancefloor // in the restroom // on the news // in my chest

There are another fifty bodies that look like mine // amp are

Dead // amp I’ve been marching for Black Lives amp talking about police brutality

Against Native communities too // for years now // but this morning

I feel it // I really feel it again // How can we imagine ourselves // We being black native

Today // Brown people // How can we imagine ourselves

When All the Dead Boys Look Like Us // Once I asked my nephew where he wanted

To go to College // What career he would like // as if

The whole world was his for the choosing // Once he answered me without fearing

Tombstones or cages or the hands from a father // The hands of my lover

Yesterday praised my whole body // Made angels from my lips // Ave Maria

Full of Grace // He propped me up like the roof of a cathedral // in NYC

Before we opened the news amp read // amp read about people who think two brown queers

Can’t build cathedrals // only cemeteries // amp each time we kiss

A funeral plot opens // In the bedroom I accept his kiss // amp I lose my reflection

I’m tired of writing this poem // but I want to say one last word about

Yesterday // my father called // I heard him cry for only the second time in my life

He sounded like he loved me // it’s something I’m rarely able to hear

amp I hope // if anything // his sound is what my body remembers first"
Thomas McGrathAll the Dead Soldiers"In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something—
A puling anger a cold wind stiffened by flying bone—
Out of the north 
and remember then what’s up there
That ghost-bank home Amchitka boot hill 

They must be very tired those ghosts no flesh sustains them
And the bones rust in the rain
Reluctant to go into the earth
The skulls gleam wet the dog-tag forgets the name
The statistics wherein they were young like their crosses are weathering out

They must be very tired
But I see them riding home
Nightly crying weak lust and rage to stand in the dark
Forlorn in known rooms unheard near familiar beds
Where lie the aging women who were so lovely once"

John FullerAll the Members of My Tribe Are Liars"Think of a self-effacing missionary
Tending the vices of a problem tribe
He knows the quickest cure for beri-beri
And how to take a bribe

And so the mind will never say it’s beaten
By primitive disturbance of the liver
Its logic will prevent its being eaten
Get it across the river

But faced with this assured inconsequence
That damns the very method that is used
It leaves the heart unproselytised and hence
Admits that it’s confused

I know I’m acting but I still must act
I melt to foolishness and want it ended
Why it continues is this simple fact
I’d hate to end it

For now the jungle moods assert their terms
And there’s no way to check them if they lie
The mind attempts to solve the thing but squirms
And knows exactly why

The world is everything that is the case
You cannot see it if you are inside it
That’s why the tortoise always wins the race
the very terms decide it

I cannot help it if I am contented
With being discontented that I falter
That’s why psychology was first invented
So that we needn’t alter

It is a strange position to be in
It would be different if I didn’t know
Why the unlikely animal should win
Which cannibal should row

You’d think there’d be a way of cutting out
Those self-destructive layers of introspection
To reach the truth at last without a doubt
Of making the connection

That’s why the missionary on his guard
Is wondering why the cannibal’s so merry
And why it is so very very hard
To be a missionary"

her peaceful sleep
at last in a purple
robe with her head
back slippered feet
up and twisted
knuckle hands crossed
right over left
in her lap

Through the south window
in your old room
you see leaves
on the giant ash tree
turning yellow again
in setting sun
and falling slowly
to the ground and one
by one all the questions

Number one down

Those who hear the train they had better worry worry
those who hear they had better worry worry


No disgrace to worry to have the worried life blues
might do some good to be worried in the hour of our need


Run run run away going to run run run away
there are those who think they’re going to run away


To hear and to be facing and to be facing what is heard
to hear and to be face to face with what is heard


Run run run away they’re going to run run run away
there are those who think they’re going to run away from the train


Fort built to protect the community from desert raiders
community thought to protect itself from raiders


Those who hear the train they had better worry worry
better worry worry about a gift of tears


Those who are gathered in the fort had better learn
they had better learn how to cure their wounds


The train with its poison and its tongue
the lurking train with its poison and its tongue


Those who are gathered better learn to be insensitive
learn how to put on a show of being insensitive


Danger of its poison and of its tongue
danger of its poison and of its tongue against our teeth


Had better break the habit the habit of prayer
better let the jokes come back to us when we’re at prayer


What really kills me is standing in the need of prayer
standing in a gathering in the need of prayer


Don’t if we don’t if we don’t break the habit
we will be made to climb all the steps of the ladder


Brood over someone else’s dream three-story red tower
beneath the tower the train is always departing


Danger of its tongue for those gathered like a group
gathered like a group of all virgins with their downcast eyes


There is this problem with cutting off the prayer hand
there is this problem with the other hand


How insensitive is how those who hear better be
how insensitive how unmoved and cold they had better be


You can call him you can call him up and ask him
if we had only asked for “Sleep Walk by Santo amp Johnny


Red tower green sky three-story tower against green sky
beneath the tower the train is always departing


Don’t break it be made to climb all the steps
we don’t break it we’ll be made to climb all the steps


Ant on the floor the small ant on the kitchen floor
the small ant anticipates by sound or shadow


Light turns out in the kitchen when somebody pulls on the string
those gathered not able to anticipate the danger


If we had only stayed in the school of the prophets
in the school of the prophets who catch thoughts from words


Ant on the floor the small ant on the kitchen floor
those gathered not able to anticipate the danger


Those who are gathered are fondled and taken by the hand
taken by the hand and made to climb all the steps


Perfectly built fort bound to make the community unhappy
bound to make those in the community unhappy


What really kills me is standing in the need of prayer
I’m standing in the need of jokes that come back


Standing in the need of prayer in a perfectly built fort
bound to make you unhappy bound to make me unhappy


Not broken the habit of prayer not been broken
those who are gathered better learn how to cure their wounds"

Mary KarrAll This and More"The Devil’s tour of hell did not include
a factory line where molten lead
spilled into mouths held wide

no electric drill spiraling screws
into hands and feet nor giant pliers
to lower you into simmering vats

Instead a circle of light
opened on your stuffed armchair
whose chintz orchids did not boil and change

and the Devil adjusted
your new spiked antennae
almost delicately with claws curled

and lacquered black before he spread
his leather wings to leap
into the acid-green sky

So your head became a tv hull
a gargoyle mirror Your doppelganger
sloppy at the mouth

and swollen at the joints
enacted your days in sinuous
slow motion your lines delivered

with a mocking sneer Sometimes
the frame froze reversed began
again the red eyes of a friend

you cursed your girl child cowered
behind the drapes parents alive again
and puzzled by this new form That’s why

you clawed your way back to this life"
Timothy LiuAll Trains Are Going Local"Slowing down your body enough to feel

Thought you were at a standstill
but you were only slowing down enough

to feel the pain There are worse things

than running to catch the train twisting
your ankle the afternoon fucked

Running to get to or away from

the stranger who helps you up
wants to know you who are so used to

anything scribbled on a prescription blank

Just want the pain to go away you say
surprised to find yourself

reaching for someone elses hand"

I was given a house The curtains breathed over wide sills There was a leaf in the middle of the floor I loved the crispness of the leaf I loved the privacy of sills The sills sailed I fell into the sills The sills got between me and God

I was given a mud hut The walls curved to meet the ceiling like a tongue curves to make a word

I was given God with salt and sweet together I was given a piece of meat I loved the flesh I was given bread only I was given only water I loved the coolness of the water The water got between me and the feast

I had an empty plate and there was the color of it I cannot even describe the color of it

I was given nothing but the air and the air dazzled"

C D WrightAlla Breve Loving"Three people drinking out of the bottle
in the living room
A cold rain Quiet as a mirror

One of the men
stuffs his handkerchief in his coat
climbs the stairs with the girl
The other man is left sitting

at the desk with the wine and the headache
turning an old Ellington side
over in his mind And over

He held her like a saxophone
when she was his girl
Her tongue trembling at the reed

The man lying next to her now
thinks of another woman
Her white breath idling

before he drove off
He said something about a spell
watching the snow fall on her shoulders

The musician
crawls back into his horn
ancient terrapin
at the approach of the wheel"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""In a seaside desert port
that wasn’t yet a city
our grandfather built a wide house
and called it gulistan

There were no roses there
just the new government
four children that would be seven and a porch
where he stitched shoes and mixed paste
for paper maché book bindings

He counted buds
and tended love birds
built their cage and bedecked it
in blue and green and red
foil this and gota that
a cage the cat got into
in front of the open water tankard
the children got into
during this or that fatal game
Loose with life

while their father cycled home
in starched and ironed whites
polished porch stitched black leather shoes
a narrow mustache
we now associate with genocide

What is reverence anyway
who writes the reverence rules
After our grandmother died
he developed a taste for Western sweets
Flintstones pushpops and cokes and nerds

Of all the things he typed
and the typing was profuse
none changed the course of history

Like the verses of the Qur’an
rendered in @ signs
which he used as a coiled pixel
taxing the Smith-Corona
Coronamatic with his gridded plan

Let’s hate the names of things
like this

Before they changed the world with typewriters
the Smith brothers manufactured firearms
Cartridge and ribbon
bullet and thermal transfer
Syracuse and gulistan

Verses laid out in rows of @
seven @s in a vertical row
to make an alif
@s like a fallen E
to make a tashdeed
He did the whole Qur’an this way

At some point in paleography
they discovered this sign filling in
for the A of Amen or Ameen
in a Bulgarian version
of a fourteenth century Greek chronicle

Why and for whom or does
The Book short circuit this question

A smaller selection I have
is a better plot for dirt ministrations
just sura  ayah 
inna Allaha maaAa al sabireen
Allah is with the patient ones

laid out in vertical reflection
its geometry a formal garden
hemmed by squares of @
looking in four directions
paths and hedges of invocation
borders of apostrophe
trees of hail and leaves of call

I wonder did he think
his helical pixels looked like roses
I wonder did he count
the buds in every verse"
Emily BerryAllegiances"In the nighttime house I don’t know where you are
My allegiances could change
How can I stop my allegiances from changing
Morning is a gown put on at midnight but no one’s coming
I don’t know what your secrets are
You say you have no secrets but I can feel them
they’re bumps under the blanket
You do not let me in
This mood kept me up all night like stars in my face
like the burning fuel of dead stars burning right through my face
So now I have my own secrets
This voyage at nighttime these burning holes
I can’t take you with me —
I don’t know who you are
You say it’s me but I’m dreaming
I can’t recognize anything except someone else’s song
which sounds like a kind of siren
it’s calling me it puts a light on
Give me three reasons
Oh you think I test you
You think I work you too hard
You think it’s too much to make you master the task
on your blue-black knees at 
am

James LongenbachAllegory"



In the Forest of    Wearisome Sadness
Where one day I found myself wandering alone
I met my heart who called to me asking me where I was going

The path was long and straight row after row of conifers receding
To a horizon that because of   the geometry
Seemed farther than it really was
Like the door at the top of a staircase in Versailles

But as if   the forest’s maker had been offended by elegance
A pile of rocks disrupted the rows the forest once
Had been a field I remember that field

I was carried there by my father beside him
My grandfather who planted the trees
Until they were tall enough to survive
He mowed the field piling up rocks taking down brush with a scythe

How since I’ve known the forest almost since birth could I have been lost
Why since the forest is beautiful is it not a place of delight

Repeatedly I asked these questions of my heart
But like a good physician he elected
To keep silent leaving me to answer for myself







Late at night when I’m lying in bed and cannot sleep
My heart reads to me from the Romance of   Pleasant Thought
Always I’ve heard the story before and typically
Since the stories are true I am their hero

I’m riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where I was born
Because I am unsupervised I indulge in what seems at the moment
A daring wish I ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler

Immediately I am overcome with remorse
The evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen
And for the first time in my life I contemplate a lie

Would my shirt dry faster if I stood in the sun where it’s hot
Or in the shade where cool breezes rustle the leaves

In the version of this story that appears now
In the Romance of Pleasant Thought
I admire not so much my ingenuity
As the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism
The way I manage terror by examining how things work








It’s done there’s nothing more to say
My heart is gone from me
Because he has fallen in love
He has abandoned me

It’s pointless making myself uncomfortable over this
By being mournful or sad
It’s done there’s nothing more to say
My heart is gone from me

He does nothing but mock me
When I tell him pitifully
That I cannot live on my own
He does not listen
It’s done there’s nothing more to say

After Charles d’Orleans"
Stanley MossAllegory of Evil in Italy"The Visconti put you on their flag a snake
devouring a child or are you throwing up a man
feet first Some snakes hunt frogs some freedom of will
There’s good in you a man can count years on your skin
Generously you mother and father a stolen boy
to the chosen you offer your cake of figs
A goiter on my neck you lick my ear with lies
yet I must listen smile and kiss your cheek
or you may swallow the child completely In Milan
there is a triptych the throned Virgin in glory
placed on the marble below a dead naked man
and a giant dead frog of human scale on its back
There’s hope My eyes look into the top of my head
at the wreath of snakes that sometimes crowns me"

D H LawrenceAlmond Blossom"Even iron can put forth
Even iron

This is the iron age
But let us take heart
Seeing iron break and bud
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom

The almond-tree
Decembers bare iron hooks sticking out of earth

The almond-tree
That knows the deadliest poison like a snake
In supreme bitterness

Upon the iron and upon the steel
Odd flakes as if of snow odd bits of snow
Odd crumbs of melting snow

But you mistake it is not from the sky
From out the iron and from out the steel
Flying not down from heaven but storming up
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
Along the iron to the living steel
In rose-hot tips and flakes of rose-pale snow
Setting supreme annunciation to the world

Nay what a heart of delicate super-faith
Iron-breaking
The rusty swords of almond-trees

Trees suffer like races down the long ages
They wander and are exiled they live in exile through long ages
Like drawn blades never sheathed hacked and gone black
The alien trees in alien lands and yet
The heart of blossom
The unquenchable heart of blossom

Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine none more scarred and frail
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
From the small wound-stump

Even the wilful obstinate gummy fig-tree
Can be kept down but hell burst like a polyp into prolixity

And the almond-tree in exile in the iron age

This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked amphoras craters cantharus oenochoe and open-hearted cylix
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

Iron but unforgotten
Iron dawn-hearted
Ever-beating dawn-heart enveloped in iron against the exile against the ages

See it come forth in blossom
From the snow-remembering heart
In long-nighted January
In the long dark nights of the evening star and Sirius and the Etna snow-wind through the long night

Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
Into blossom into pride into honey-triumph into most exquisite splendour
Oh give me the tree of life in blossom
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers

Something must be reassuring to the almond in the evening star and the snow-wind and the long long nights
Some memory of far sun-gentler lands
So that the faith in his heart smiles again
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds unfolds
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth steps out in one stride
A naked tree of blossom like a bridegroom bathing in dew divested of cover
Frail-naked utterly uncovered
To the green night-baying of the dog-star Etnas snow-edged wind
And Januarys loud-seeming sun

Think of it from the iron fastness
Suddenly to dare to come out naked in perfection of blossom beyond the sword-rust
Think to stand there in full-unfolded nudity smiling
With all the snow-wind and the sun-glare and the dog-star baying epithalamion

Oh honey-bodied beautiful one
Come forth from iron
Red your heart is
Fragile-tender fragile-tender life-body
More fearless than iron all the time
And so much prouder so disdainful of reluctances

In the distance like hoar-frost like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious

In the garden raying out
With a body like spray dawn-tender and looking about
With such insuperable subtly-smiling assurance
Sword-blade-born

Unpromised
No bounds being set
Flaked out and come unpromised
The tree being life-divine
Fearing nothing life-blissful at the core
Within iron and earth

Knots of pink fish-silvery
In heaven in blue blue heaven
Soundless bliss-full wide-rayed honey-bodied
Red at the core
Red at the core
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light

Open
Open
Five times wide open
Six times wide open
And given and perfect
And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness
Sore-hearted-looking"

Our love was threat like phantom pain
An almost-plan for a bullet train

I’m weaning myself off graphic tees
not taking on any new disease

Camille T DungyAlmost Like They Wanted It"Because shed heard him laugh through new moon darkness
and she knew hed fallen and she knew before she turned
hed be crawling like a crawdad rock to loam—

because she tried to love the straight back and neck
hed erected to recollect the man hed been
before—because she found herself adding up his usefulness

like some kind of auctioneer—she showed him
the dark coils areoling both her breasts and all the ways
she bent and lifted bent and lifted steady strong

She let him believe he was past due for a harvest
and her hands were the right ones now to hold onto the scythe

•


She made quick work of pleasure The boysmile bunked down
in his eyes she claimed Her tongue found the place in his mouth
where the teeth were gone—where hed hold his corncakes

until they grew soft enough to chew History had bedded him
in all of this—his own history and failures not his own
Before hed tramped in shed watched another man—a man shed thought

shed hated—watched his body opened opened opened until
blood had married brine Shed watch that man be whipped into something
good for nothing more than fertilizing clay and shed thought

buckshot would have been a brand of kindness if sprayed into him
just then But even after his hard going she did not miss him very much

•


Anyone she chose could be shucked like surplus property tomorrow
but that hadnt been enough to warn her off of picking him that night
Because she knew if she set her sight on nothing shed get nothing

in return shed walked with him But because the night progressed so
—because there were some clouds—no stars—no moon—hed tripped
over the branch of a dead and down tree In all that darkness

there without a moon even then she had not fallen She thought
to say so but she did not say so She did nothing
but say she was sorry for him She did not use her mouth

to say this Could he not listen to her hands They spoke softly
articulating her condolences to his torn and bleeding skin"

and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats

And ’tis there the birds oft love to dwell
And sip the honey from thy lips"
Jack GilbertAlone"I never thought Michiko would come back
after she died But if she did I knew
it would be as a lady in a long white dress
It is strange that she has returned
as somebodys dalmation I meet
the man walking her on a leash
almost every week He says good morning
and I stoop down to calm her He said
once that she was never like that with
other people Sometimes she is tethered
on their lawn when I go by If nobody
is around I sit on the grass When she
finally quiets she puts her head in my lap
and we watch each others eyes as I whisper
in her soft ears She cares nothing about
the mystery She likes it best when
I touch her head and tell her small
things about my days and our friends
That makes her happy the way it always did"
Matthew SweeneyAlone"Was it Pascal who said “Almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms” Baudelaire thought it might have been but was not sure And let’s take a look at that “almost” which I’m very glad is there I can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room When I get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work I had high hopes for is one example Or to go way back when I returned home to find my white mouse dead when I was eleven or twelve Or to take a mundane example when a plane I’m booked on is twelve hours delayed while I hang about the airport
I have never had a huge problem with solitude it is true As a child I read voraciously and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book The game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone especially very early on a beautiful morning The time when I most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days At the end of that time I felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months
Baudelaire claimed his friend the Devil loved bleak solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite He decided that this was not really a danger for most of us though only for those idle fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming The type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit But what’s to stop these people being verbose in their own company Did Crusoe for example stay quiet on his island before Friday came According to Elizabeth Bishop in her great poem “Crusoe in England” he did not
And in order to write that poem Ms Bishop needed to be alone This did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her After this probably the next morning she went back to the poem and her solitude
I feel the French maybe exaggerate the benefits of  being alone That philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre for example his play Huis-clos with its famous line “L’enfer c’est les autres” Yes we all know how annoying other people often are and how strong the urge to escape from them can be But the two characters Vladimir and Estragon in Beckett’s Waiting for Godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance It’s said Beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Two Men Contemplating the Moon which he saw on a trip to Germany in  or ’ In both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man’s shoulder a sign of companionship if ever there was one
Baudelaire quotes the French philosopher and moralist Jean de la Bruyère or Delabruyère as the man signed himself “What a great misfortune we cannot be alone” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar What about the great French word fraternité the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the Revolution I want to close this by giving another quote from de la Bruyère “Out of difficulties grow miracles” I prefer this one Anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that"
Edgar Allan Poe“Alone”"From childhood’s hour I have not been
As others were—I have not seen
As others saw—I could not bring
My passions from a common spring—
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow—I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone—
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
Of a most stormy life—was drawn
From ev’ry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still—
From the torrent or the fountain—
From the red cliff of the mountain—
From the sun that ’round me roll’d
In its autumn tint of gold—
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass’d me flying by—
From the thunder and the storm—
And the cloud that took the form
When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view—"

Alison Pelegrin"Alone Drinking with the Tickfaw River""Featherweight lawn chair cooler for a footrest
and me a squatter on the landlords dock
where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day
until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep
Day and night I snoozed on the porch
beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades
to the opera of my neighbors fighting
and reconciling in the glow of stolen wattage

I saw them swimming once Maybe naked
judging from their skittish talk but the water
smeared their bodies pale particulars
It was just me and the Tickfaw River
Me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth
feeling no pain lighting a cigarette backwards
the Tickfaw tricking me closer and closer
with echoes and music out of nowhere

Is it funny that I was too lit to notice
twenty-five orange yards of extension cord
stretching from my outlet over the driveway shells
to feed the hungry plug of their deep freezer
Mother would have pitched a fit if she discovered
the stash of whiskey in the woodpile
and my father wasnt laughing
if he looked down from his company of stars"
Jane KenyonAlone for a Week"I washed a load of clothes
and hung them out to dry
Then I went up to town
and busied myself all day
The sleeve of your best shirt
rose ceremonious
when I drove in our night-
clothes twined and untwined in
a little gust of wind

For me it was getting late
for you where you were not
The harvest moon was full
but sparse clouds made its light
not quite reliable
The bed on your side seemed
as wide and flat as Kansas
your pillow plump cool
and allegorical   "
Osip Mandelstam“Alone I stare into the frost’s white face”"Alone I stare into the frost’s white face
It’s going nowhere and I—from nowhere
Everything ironed flat pleated without a wrinkle
Miraculous the breathing plain

Meanwhile the sun squints at this starched poverty—
The squint itself consoled at ease   
The ten-fold forest almost the same   
And snow crunches in the eyes innocent like clean bread

Linda Gregg"Alone with the Goddess
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""The young men ride their horses fast
on the wet sand of Parangtritis
Back and forth with the water sliding
up to them and away
This is the sea where the goddess lives
angry her lover taken away
Don’t wear red don’t wear green here
the people say Do not swim in the sea
Give her an offering
I give a coconut to protect
the man I love The water pushes it back
I wade out and throw it farther
“The goddess does not accept your gift”
an old woman says
I say perhaps she likes me
and we are playing a game
The old woman is silent
the horses wear blinders of cloth
the young men exalt in their bodies
not seeing right or left pretending
to be brave Sliding on and off
their beautiful horses
on the wet beach at Parangtritis"
Ernest M HemingwayAlong with Youth"A porcupine skin
Stiff with bad tanning
It must have ended somewhere
Stuffed horned owl
Pompous
Yellow eyed
Chuck-wills-widow on a biassed twig
Sooted with dust
Piles of old magazines
Drawers of boy’s letters
And the line of love
They must have ended somewhere
Yesterday’s Tribune is gone
Along with youth
And the canoe that went to pieces on the beach
The year of the big storm
When the hotel burned down
At Seney Michigan"
Rita Mae ReeseThe Alphabet Conspiracy"The word is the making of the world — Wallace Stevens


It’s a filmstrip afternoon
and we’re all grateful
to the humming projector
in the middle of our desks
the closed blinds the absence of a real adult

There’s a vague promise of revelation
from the title
and the dark tree-lined streets the voice
calling from a house
carrying within it our freedom not to answer

Inside another house a little girl in a pretty dress
is falling asleep
at her father’s desk turning into
Alice in Wonderland
as her mind falls down the rabbit holes of grammar

The Mad Hatter and Jabberwocky
tell her to lure
the letters into a trap so they can beat them
to death with mallets
We’d like to see that Without words

no one could tell us what to do
We know grammar is just a byproduct
like schizophrenia of a brain that grew
too fast for its own good
and that history is a series of conspiracies

by accidental despots Mrs Bradford is
falling asleep on the wide window ledge
her blue polyester pants gapped
to reveal her white socks
and pink spotted shins We try not to look

The Mad Hatter doesn’t say that the alphabet
was first used to keep track of property
or that for centuries people believed
if women learned to write
the lost world would never be recovered

or that the Mayans believed
outsiders wrote things down
not in order to remember them
but to free themselves
into the work of forgetting

That year Mrs Bradford taught us about
the Lewis amp Clark expedition
over and over again We never learned
why it mattered so much to her
or what possible use it could be to anyone

The professor tells Judy about
the thousands of words
Arabs needed for camels and their parts
the dozen words Eskimos had for snow
and a chimp who learned seven human words

A voice made visible says
magic is a matter of fact to you
Every miracle has to have its qualifications
reservations footnotes
and our heads rise from our desks

The rest of the year will be a series of
substitute teachers
who teach us nothing but footnotes
and their own reservations
Mrs Bradford dead of a brain tumor

We sit in our sixth-grade desks with the blinds
closed against the tree-lined streets
as the letters of the world rise up
and forming a single word
eclipse our world and fill our mouths with shadows"
Susan WheelerAlphabets End"So Ill speak ill of the dead A was crooked
planting the small left finger of the raccoon in the upholstery

In the videos of C a jejune overwhelmed the cast

Ralph AngelAlpine Wedding"All dark morning long the clouds are rising slowly up
beneath us and we are fast asleep
The mountains unmove

intensely And so do we Meadows
look down

A city there looks up and
stirs a little Adrift the rolling tiled roofs of
buildings the deadly

trains of grinding sand and morning—
a spy unfolds his paper

the coffee’s served

A bride and groom stand shivering on a tarmac
in the mist and
they are happy Each one

and all of us entangled the room is moist with us
the house unfinished windowless

and we are fast asleep

The brother of the groom can’t get
close enough He leans against the brightest ridge
and ladder the sucking

sound of memory
as heaven picks up speed and

hurtles through his burning skin
its frozen blankets
to the sun"
Ghassan ZaqtanAlso the House"Near the camp was a river
and in our house were absentees and hands
that will one day wake us in vain

I had just turned seven
while he was sitting in the shade
ironing his clothes
the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders

I paid no attention to the road
or the three steps
and didnt notice the carpet

I dont remember who was it that said
to me or to another
""When you grow up poetry will become your house""

The dust that eats the memories
always distances those folks

yet their chairs appear from afar
from behind the hills and over the houses
to hang in an air of summer and holm oak
those shaded chairs that reach the heart
on shoulders topped
with five flowers

Which flowers are speech
which flowers are silence

And I cant remember
whether it was my uncle who stood at the door
whether we had palm and lotus trees
in our house in Karameh

whether my mother
who gave birth to me on the shelf
was folding our clothes behind our fathers back
so he could sleep

The watchdogs used to cry from the heat
and poetry Husseini of Jerusalem
and Khidr the mystic were all in our house
as was my uncle who came from a pond
within Hebrons walls

Twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us
we have grown older
and thats that

My father used to discompose his friends
with his days and women
with the thread of seduction in his voice
as he would sprinkle chatter in their rivers
while walking about here or there with a lilt
hed let his days fall off him
and let others gather them as he walked
on gold that came only for him

And I cant remember
in our courtyard there were holm oaks
a fountain a tiled floor by a huge door
we were confused and in a hurry

The closet that faced us in the second room
had a mirror
the mirror we now seek

And my father was standing alone in the hall that led
the stairs to the roof
thanking his days
or preparing for Wednesdays nap
or Thursdays morning
as he left among the things hed leave the water can
full of water
while around his chairs our Saturdays rose

My father didnt want too much from life
a house five boys
who dont mess with his papers
which were already chaos
and two girls
so that braids could float all around the house"
Marilyn Chin“Altar #” from “Broken Chord Sequence”"Why cry over dried flowers
They’re meant to be straw
Why cry over miniature roses
They’re meant to be small

Why cry over Buddha’s hand citron
Why cry over the hidden flower
Why cry over Mother’s burnt forehead
Her votive deathglow her finest hour"

Made of a heart and cemented with tears
Whose parts are as thy hand did frame
No workmans tool hath touchd the same
A HEART alone
Is such a stone
As nothing but
Thy powr doth cut
Wherefore each part
Of my hard heart
Meets in this frame
To praise thy name
That if I chance to hold my peace
These stones to praise thee may not cease
Oh let thy blessed SACRIFICE be mine

How many hours I kept
that vigil by your side—
entire nights eyes wide
as you so sweetly slept

What I was wondering
why you yearned to evade
the real No one has prayed
harder for anything

It wasn’t for your life
I feared but for mankind
Did you in the end find
secrets for changing life



 DEFACED AFTER RILKE

The head we cannot know
nor its bright fruit the eyes
And yet the body has
its gaze a lamp turned low

Or else the breast would cease
to dazzle the hips fail
to curve into that smile
that begets more than a kiss

And flesh would lose all life
not flare till there’s no blind
it can’t see you behind
You must change your life



 DENIAL AFTER SEFERIS

The afternoon grew hotter
along our secret shore
We thirsted in the glare
but couldn’t drink the water

On golden sand we traced
your name beside the sea
The wind came like a sigh
our writing was erased

How passionate our life
how full of sex and song
spirit and heart—how wrong
And so we changed our life"

counting moon phases

mostly about toucans

Anne PorterAn Altogether Different Language"There was a church in Umbria Little Portion
Already old eight hundred years ago
It was abandoned and in disrepair
But it was called St Mary of the Angels
For it was known to be the haunt of angels
Often at night the country people
Could hear them singing there

What was it like to listen to the angels
To hear those mountain-fresh those simple voices
Poured out on the bare stones of Little Portion
In hymns of joy
No one has told us
Perhaps it needs another language
That we have still to learn
An altogether different language"
Molly PeacockAltruism"What if we got outside ourselves and there
really was an outside out there not just
our insides turned inside out What if there
really were a you beyond me not just
the waves off my own fire like those waves off
the backyard grill you can see the next yard through
though not well -- just enough to know that off
to the right belongs to someone else not you
What if when we said I love you there were
a you to love as there is a yard beyond
to walk past the grill and get to To endure
the endless walk through the self knowing through a bond
that has no basis for ourselves are all we know
is altruism not giving but coming to know
someone is there through the wavy vision
of the selfs heat love become a decision"
Luis J RodríguezAlways Running"All night vigil
My two-and-a-half-year-old boy
and his -month-old sister
lay on the same bed
facing opposite ends
their feet touching
They looked soft peaceful
bundled there in strands of blankets
I brushed away roaches that meandered
across their faces
but not even that could wake them
Outside the dark cover of night tore
as daybreak bloomed like a rose
on a stem of thorns
I sat down on the backsteps
gazing across the yellowed yard
A  Chevy Bel-Air stared back
It was my favorite possession
I hated it just then
It didn’t start when I tried to get it going
earlier that night It had a bad solenoid
I held a -gauge shotgun across my lap
I expected trouble from the Paragons gang
of the west Lynwood barrio
Somebody said I dove the car
that dudes from Colonia Watts used
to shoot up the Paragons’ neighborhood
But I got more than trouble that night
My wife had left around  pm
to take a friend of mine home
She didn’t come back
I wanted to kill somebody
At moments it had nothing to do
with the Paragons
It had to do with a woman I loved
But who to kill Not her–
sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt
I’d kill myself first
Kill me first
But she was the one who quit
Kill her No think man I was hurt angry  
but to kill her To kill a Paragon
To kill anybody
I went into the house
and put the gun away

Later that morning my wife came for her things
some clothes the babies   their toys
A radio broken TV and some dishes remained
I didn’t stop her
There was nothing to say that my face
didn’t explain already
Nothing to do   but run

So I drove the long haul to Downey
and parked near an enclosed area
alongside the Los Angeles River
I got out of the car
climbed over the fence
and stumbled down the slopes
A small line of water rippled in the middle
On rainy days this place flooded and flowed
but most of the time it was dry
with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture
Since a child the river and its veins of canals
were places for me to think Places to heal
Once on the river’s bed I began to cleanse
I ran

I ran into the mist of morning
carrying the heat of emotion
through the sun’s rays
I ran past the factories
that lay smack in the middle
of somebody’s backyard
I ran past alleys with overturned trashcans
and mounds of tires
Debris lay underfoot Overgrown weeds
scraped my legs as I streamed past
recalling the song of bullets
that whirred in the wind

I ran across bridges beneath overhead passes
and then back alongside the infested walls
of the concrete river
splashing rainwater as I threaded
my heels colliding against the pavement
So much energy propelled my legs
and just like the river
it went on for miles

When all was gone
the concrete river
was always there
and me always running"
Stephen DunnAlways Something More Beautiful"This time I came to the starting place
with my best running shoes and pure speed
held back for the finish came with only love
of the clock and the underfooting
and the other runners Each of us would
be testing excellence and endurance

in the other though in the past I’d often
veer off to follow some feral distraction
down a side path allowing myself
to pursue something odd or beautiful
becoming acquainted with a few of the ways
not to blame myself for failing to succeed

I had come to believe what’s beautiful
had more to do with daring
to take yourself seriously to stay
the course whatever the course might be
The person in front seemed ready to fade
his long graceful stride shortening

as I came up along his side I was sure now
I’d at least exceed my best time
But the man with the famous final kick
already had begun his moveBeautiful I heard
a spectator say as if something inevitable
about to come from nowhere was again on its way"
Bob Dahlquistalwaysendeavor"Bob Dahlquist is an artist whose work I first noticed in New York Citys Bryant Park where I saw staring down at me an imaginative logo for a sandwich shop The logo demonstrated Dahlquists grasp of what I call the printers fist—an understanding of the visual and intellectual significance of typographic characters His ""alwaysendeavor"" replicates the look of old-fashioned office signs etched into translucent glass doors but in this case we see the text from both sides at once and we must pull apart the strands of overlapping text to reconstitute the meaning—Geof Huth

where she hid a boy
The boy and his bike flee
the girl’s parents from the tip
of the leaves green summer light

The amaranth is an imaginary flower

stuck out its green tongue
and slowly day by day
the flower itself entered our world

Kahlil GibranAmbition"Three men met at a tavern table One was a weaver another a
carpenter and the third a ploughman

Said the weaver “I sold a fine linen shroud today for two pieces
of gold Let us have all the wine we want”

“And I” said the carpenter “I sold my best coffin We will have
a great roast with the wine”

“I only dug a grave” said the ploughman “but my patron paid me
double Let us have honey cakes too”

And all that evening the tavern was busy for they called often
for wine and meat and cakes And they were merry

And the host rubbed his hands and smiled at his wife for his guests
were spending freely

When they left the moon was high and they walked along the road
singing and shouting together

The host and his wife stood in the tavern door and looked after
them

“Ah” said the wife “these gentlemen So freehanded and so gay
If only they could bring us such luck every day Then our son need
not be a tavern-keeper and work so hard We could educate him
and he could become a priest”"
Anne SextonThe Ambition Bird"So it has come to this –
insomnia at  AM
the clock tolling its engine

like a frog following
a sundial yet having an electric
seizure at the quarter hour

The business of words keeps me awake
I am drinking cocoa
the warm brown mama

I would like a simple life
yet all night I am laying
poems away in a long box

It is my immortality box
my lay-away plan
my coffin

All night dark wings
flopping in my heart
Each an ambition bird

The bird wants to be dropped
from a high place like Tallahatchie Bridge

He wants to light a kitchen match
and immolate himself

He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo
and come out painted on a ceiling

He wants to pierce the hornet’s nest
and come out with a long godhead

He wants to take bread and wine
and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean

He wants to be pressed out like a key
so he can unlock the Magi

He wants to take leave among strangers
passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres

He wants to die changing his clothes
and bolt for the sun like a diamond

He wants I want
Dear God wouldn’t it be
good enough just to drink cocoa

I must get a new bird
and a new immortality box
There is folly enough inside this one"

gliding on air

yellow shoulder patches
black hair like feathers
clinging to her head
face the color of red cedar

following Grandpa’s red boots
Then the two figures swoop around the

Yehuda AmichaiThe Amen Stone"On my desk there is a stone with the word “Amen” on it
a triangular fragment of stone from a Jewish graveyard destroyed
many generations ago The other fragments hundreds upon hundreds
were scattered helter-skelter and a great yearning
a longing without end fills them all
first name in search of family name date of death seeks
dead man’s birthplace son’s name wishes to locate
name of father date of birth seeks reunion with soul
that wishes to rest in peace And until they have found
one another they will not find a perfect rest
Only this stone lies calmly on my desk and says “Amen”
But now the fragments are gathered up in lovingkindness
by a sad good man He cleanses them of every blemish
photographs them one by one arranges them on the floor
in the great hall makes each gravestone whole again
one again fragment to fragment
like the resurrection of the dead a mosaic
a jigsaw puzzle Child’s play"
Esther LeeAmening"Model prisoner or not I wont

Silver lash hounds tooth
meager sinful towns crook

I am nervous again I could kill
if you let me But tonight Ill be still
under this palm Zeroed out
the tea my toilet muck

Licorice and almond
twisted beneath the sink
Im lovely again Come on
with my dying

Today the globes underside
isnt pink but rather

I look ahead toward what
has happened"
Heather McHughThe Amenities"I owe you an explanation
My first memory isn’t your own
of an empty box My babyhood cabinets held
a countlessness of cakes my backyard
rotted into apple glut windfalls of
money-tree mouthfuls of fib

At puberty I liked the locks
I was the one who made them fast
The yelling in our hallways was about
lost money or lost love but not
lost life Or so I see it now
in those days I romanticized
a risk I thought I’d die
in the alcoholic automobile die
at the hands of nerveless dentistry Small hearts
were printed in the checkbook when my parents called me
dear they meant expensive

Where were you in all that time Out looking for
your father’s body Making for your mother’s room
I got my A’s in English civics
sweetness and light you got black eyes and F’s
and nowhere fast By  when we met
if you could call it making an acquaintance
rape I was a mal-adjusted gush a sucker for
placebos Walking home from Central Square I came to have
the good girl’s petty dread the woman

to whose yard you dragged me might
detect us and be furious More than anything else
I wanted no one mad at me Propriety
or was it property I thought
to guard myself I gave away

And as for you you had the shakes
were barely seventeen yourself too raw
to get it up I said don’t be afraid
afraid of what might happen if you failed
And afterwards in one of those moments
it’s hard to tell funny from fatal you did
a terrible civility you told me

thanks I’ll never forget
that moment all my life
It wasn’t until then as you
were sheathing it to run

I saw the knife"
Richard BlancoAmérica"I
Although Tía Miriam boasted she discovered
at least half a dozen uses for peanut butter—
topping for guava shells in syrup
butter substitute for Cuban toast
hair conditioner and relaxer—
Mamá never knew what to make
of the monthly five-pound jars
handed out by the immigration department
until my friend Jeff mentioned jelly


II
There was always pork though
for every birthday and wedding
whole ones on Christmas and New Year’s Eve
even on Thanksgiving day—pork
fried broiled or crispy skin roasted—
as well as cauldrons of black beans
fried plantain chips and yuca con mojito
These items required a special visit
to Antonio’s Mercado on the corner of Eighth Street
where men in guayaberas stood in senate
blaming Kennedy for everything—“Ese hijo de puta”
the bile of Cuban coffee and cigar residue
filling the creases of their wrinkled lips
clinging to one another’s lies of lost wealth
ashamed and empty as hollow trees

III
By seven I had grown suspicious—we were still here
Overheard conversations about returning
had grown wistful and less frequent
I spoke English my parents didn’t
We didn’t live in a two-story house
with a maid or a wood-panel station wagon
nor vacation camping in Colorado
None of the girls had hair of gold
none of my brothers or cousins
were named Greg Peter or Marcia
we were not the Brady Bunch
None of the black and white characters
on Donna Reed or on the Dick Van Dyke Show
were named Guadalupe Lázaro or Mercedes
Patty Duke’s family wasn’t like us either—
they didn’t have pork on Thanksgiving
they ate turkey with cranberry sauce
they didn’t have yuca they had yams
like the dittos of Pilgrims I colored in class

IV
A week before Thanksgiving
I explained to my abuelita
about the Indians and the Mayflower
how Lincoln set the slaves free
I explained to my parents about
the purple mountain’s majesty
“one if by land two if by sea”
the cherry tree the tea party
the amber waves of grain
the “masses yearning to be free”
liberty and justice for all until
finally they agreed
this Thanksgiving we would have turkey
as well as pork


V
Abuelita prepared the poor fowl
as if committing an act of treason
faking her enthusiasm for my sake
Mamá set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven
and prepared candied yams following instructions
I translated from the marshmallow bag
The table was arrayed with gladiolas
the plattered turkey loomed at the center
on plastic silver from Woolworth’s
Everyone sat in green velvet chairs
we had upholstered with clear vinyl
except Tío Carlos and Toti seated
in the folding chairs from the Salvation Army
I uttered a bilingual blessing
and the turkey was passed around
like a game of Russian Roulette
“DRY” Tío Berto complained and proceeded
to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings
and cranberry jelly—“esa mierda roja” he called it
Faces fell when Mamá presented her ochre pie—
pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers not a dessert
Tía María made three rounds of Cuban coffee
then Abuelo and Pepe cleared the living room furniture
put on a Celia Cruz LP and the entire family
began to merengue over the linoleum of our apartment
sweating rum and coffee until they remembered—
it was  and  degrees—
in América
After repositioning the furniture
an appropriate darkness filled the room
Tío Berto was the last to leave"
Kofi AwoonorAmerica"A name only once
crammed into the childs fitful memory
in malnourished villages
vast deliriums like the galloping foothills of the Colorado
of Mohawks and the Chippewa
horsey penny-movies
brought cheap at the tail of the war
to Africa Where indeed is the Mississippi panorama
and the girl that played the piano and
kept her hand on her heart
as Flanagan drank a quart of moonshine
before the eyes of the towns gentlemen
What happened to your locomotive in Winter Walt
and my ride across the prairies in the trail
of the stage-coach the gold-rush and the Swanee River
Where did they bury Geronimo
heroic chieftain lonely horseman of this apocalypse
who led his tribesmen across deserts of cholla
and emerald hills
in pursuit of despoilers
half-starved immigrants
from a despoiled Europe
What happened to Archibalds
souls harvest on this raw earth
of raw hates
To those that have none
a festival is preparing at graves ends
where the mockingbirds hymn
closes evening of prayers
and supplication as
new winds blow from graves
flowered in multi-colored cemeteries even
where they say the races are intact"
Tony HoaglandAmerica"Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud
Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison

Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger Kings and MTV episodes
Where you can’t tell the show from the commercials

And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he is
He says that even when he’s driving to the mall in his Isuzu

Trooper with a gang of his friends letting rap music pour over them
Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers even then he feels

Buried alive captured and suffocated in the folds
Of the thick satin quilt of America

And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade

And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last night
It was not blood but money

That gushed out of him bright green hundred-dollar bills
Spilling from his wounds and—this is the weird part—

He gasped “Thank god—those Ben Franklins were
Clogging up my heart—

And so I perish happily
Freed from that which kept me from my liberty”—

Which was when I knew it was a dream since my dad
Would never speak in rhymed couplets

And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes
And I think “I am asleep in America too

And I don’t know how to wake myself either”
And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life

“I was listening to the cries of the past
When I should have been listening to the cries of the future”

But how could he have imagined  channels of -hour cable
Or what kind of nightmare it might be

When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river

Even while others are drowning underneath you
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters

And yet it seems to be your own hand
Which turns the volume higher"
Walt WhitmanAmerica"Centre of equal daughters equal sons

Allen GinsbergAmerica"America I’ve given you all and now I’m nothing
America two dollars and twentyseven cents January  
I can’t stand my own mind
America when will we end the human war
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb
I don’t feel good don’t bother me
I won’t write my poem till I’m in my right mind
America when will you be angelic
When will you take off your clothes
When will you look at yourself through the grave
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites
America why are your libraries full of tears
America when will you send your eggs to India
I’m sick of your insane demands
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks
America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world
Your machinery is too much for me
You made me want to be a saint
There must be some other way to settle this argument
Burroughs is in Tangiers I don’t think he’ll come back it’s sinister
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke
I’m trying to come to the point
I refuse to give up my obsession
America stop pushing I know what I’m doing
America the plum blossoms are falling
I haven’t read the newspapers for months everyday somebody goes on trial for murder
America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies
America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry
I smoke marijuana every chance I get
I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet
When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid
My mind is made up there’s going to be trouble
You should have seen me reading Marx
My psychoanalyst thinks I’m perfectly right
I won’t say the Lord’s Prayer
I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations
America I still haven’t told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia
I’m addressing you
Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine
I’m obsessed by Time Magazine
I read it every week
Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore
I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library
It’s always telling me about responsibility Businessmen are serious Movie producers are serious Everybody’s serious but me
It occurs to me that I am America
I am talking to myself again

Asia is rising against me
I haven’t got a chinaman’s chance
I’d better consider my national resources
My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes  miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions
I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns
I have abolished the whorehouses of France Tangiers is the next to go
My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I’m a Catholic

America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood
I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so they’re all different sexes
America I will sell you strophes $ apiece $ down on your old strophe
America free Tom Mooney
America save the Spanish Loyalists
America Sacco amp Vanzetti must not die
America I am the Scottsboro boys
America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in  Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers’ Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain Everybody must have been a spy
America you don’t really want to go to war
America its them bad Russians
Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen And them Russians
The Russia wants to eat us alive The Russia’s power mad She wants to take our cars from out our garages
Her wants to grab Chicago Her needs a Red Reader’s Digest Her wants our auto plants in Siberia Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations
That no good Ugh Him make Indians learn read Him need big black niggers Hah Her make us all work sixteen hours a day Help
America this is quite serious
America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set
America is this correct
I’d better get right down to the job
It’s true I don’t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories I’m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway
America I’m putting my queer shoulder to the wheel

My home sweet home"
Allison Adelle Hedge Coke"America I Sing You Back""for Phil Young and my father Robert Hedge Coke
for Whitman and Hughes
America I sing back Sing back what sung you in
Sing back the moment you cherished breath
Sing you home into yourself and back to reason

Before America began to sing I sung her to sleep
held her cradleboard wept her into day
My song gave her creation prepared her delivery
held her severed cord beautifully beaded

My song helped her stand held her hand for first steps
nourished her very being fed her placed her three sisters strong
My song comforted her as she battled my reason
broke my long-held footing sure as any child might do

As she pushed herself away forced me to remove myself
as I cried this country my song grew roses in each tear’s fall

My blood-veined rivers painted pipestone quarries
circled canyons while she made herself maiden fine

But here I am here I am here I remain high on each and every peak
carefully rumbling her great underbelly prepared to pour forth singing—

and sing again I will as I have always done
Never silenced unless in the company of strangers singing
the stoic face polite repose polite while dancing deep inside polite
Mother of her world Sister of myself

When my song sings aloud again When I call her back to cradle
Call her to peer into waters to behold herself in dark and light
day and night call her to sing along call her to mature to envision—
then she will quake herself over My song will make it so

When she grows far past her self-considered purpose
I will sing her back sing her back I will sing Oh I will—I do
America I sing back Sing back what sung you in"
Gregory Corso"America Politica Historia in Spontaneity""O this political air so heavy with the bells
and motors of a slow night and no place to rest
but rain to walk—How it rings the Washington streets
The umbrella’d congressmen the rapping tires
of big black cars the shoulders of lobbyists
caught under canopies and in doorways
and it rains it will not let up
and meanwhile lame futurists weep into Spengler’s
prophecy will the world be over before the races blend color
All color must be one or let the world be done—
There’ll be a chance we’ll all be orange
I don’t want to be orange
Nothing about God’s color to complain
and there is a beauty in yellow the old Lama
in his robe the color of Cathay
in black a strong amp vital beauty
Thelonious Monk in his robe of Norman charcoal—
And if Western Civilization comes to an end
though I doubt it for the prophet has not
executed his prophecy surely the Eastern child
will sit by a window and wonder
the old statues the ornamented doors
the decorated banquet of the West—
Inflamed by futurists I too weep in rain at night
at the midnight of Western Civilization
Dante’s step into Hell will never be forgotten by Hell
the Gods’ adoption of Homer will never be forgotten by the Gods
the books of France are on God’s bookshelf
no civil war will take place on the fields of God
and I don’t doubt the egg of the East its glory—
Yet it rains and the motors go
and continued when I slept by that wall in Washington
which separated the motors in the death-parlor
where Joe McCarthy lay lean and stilled
ten blocks from the Capitol—
I could never understand Uncle Sam
his red amp white striped pants his funny whiskers his starry hat
how surreal Yankee Doodle Dandy goof
American history has a way of making you feel
George Washington is still around that is
when I think of Washington I do not think of Death—
Of all Presidents I have been under
Hoover is the most unreal
and FDR is the most President-looking
and Truman the most Jewish-looking
and Eisenhower the miscast of Time into Space—
Hoover is another America Mr 
and what must he be thinking now
FDR was my youth and how strange to still see
his wife around
Truman is still in Presidential time
I saw Eisenhower helicopter over Athens
and he looked at the Acropolis like only Zeus could
OF THE PEOPLE is fortunate and select
FOR THE PEOPLE has never happened in America or elsewhere
BY THE PEOPLE is the sadness of America
I am not politic
I am not patriotic
I am nationalistic
I boast well the beauty of America to all the people in Europe
In me they do not see their vision of America
O whenever I pass an American Embassy I don’t know what to feel
Sometimes I want to rush in and scream “I’m American”
but instead go a few paces down to the American Bar
get drunk and cry “I’m no American”
The men of politics I love are but youth’s fantasy
The fine profile of Washington on coins stamps amp tobacco wraps
The handsomeness and death-in-the-snow of Hamilton
The eyeglasses shoe-buckles kites amp keys of Ben Franklin
The sweet melancholy of Lincoln
The way I see Christ as something romantic amp unreal is the way I see them
An American is unique among peoples
He looks and acts like a boyman
He never looks cruel in uniform
He is rednecked portly rich and jolly
White-haired serious Harvard kind and wry
A convention man a family man a rotary man amp practical joker
He is moonfaced cunning well-meaning amp righteously mean
He is Madison Avenue handsome in-the-know and superstitious
He is odd happy quicker than light shameless and heroic
Great yawn of youth
The young don’t seem interested in politics anymore
Politics has lost its romance
The “bloody kitchen” has drowned
And all that is left are those granite
façades of Pentagon Justice and Department—
Politicians do not know youth
They depend on the old
and the old depend on them
and lo this has given youth a chance
to think of heaven in their independence
No need to give them liberty or freedom
where they’re at—
When Stevenson in  came to San Francisco
he campaigned in what he thought was an Italian section
He spoke of Italy and Joe DiMaggio and spaghetti
but all who were there all for him
were young beatniks and when his car drove off
Ginsberg amp I ran up to him and yelled
“When are you going to free the poets from their attics”
Great yawn of youth
Mad beautiful oldyoung America has no candidate
the craziest wildest greatest country of them all
and not one candidate—
Nixon arrives ever so temporal self-made
frontways sideways and backways
could he be America’s against Detour to vehicle
Mast to wind Shore to sea Death to life

Richard Katrovas"""American Football""""That I would even use the phrase suggests
A false yet useful worldliness a scope
Far greater than my caste would indicate
The phrase signals “I’ve lived abroad I’ve watched
The Premier League in European pubs”
In fact I hate the game its ethos rests
On boring strategies and rules that cope
Merely with competition’s link to fate
How luck and skill dovetail in every botched
Clear kick on goal and every header rubs

Against the grain of what is beautiful
In sport at least to my Yankee Doodle eyes
Give me smashmouth football over soccer
Give me concussions shattered bones ripped muscles
Strategies of season-long attrition
Give me huge men heaving their bountiful
Frames against each other with such grace that size
Seems incidental to the role of stalker
Of fleet backs and fleeter ends men who bustle
Along the line of scrimmage on a mission

A hundred and sixty-pound defensive end
I was the scourge of JV quarterbacks
I blitzed on every down so spent the game
With most the action at my back the coach
Didn’t seem to care he was drunk on power
And vodka said my job was to defend
Right flank from sweeps and register some sacks
Helter skelter I dreamed of gridiron fame
Much less than mediocre I could not broach
The fact of pain the realm where bruises flower"
Peter BethanisAmerican Future"In  the morning probably seemed harmless enough
to sign on the dotted line as the insurance man
talked to my parents for over an hour
around a coffee table about our future
This roof wasnt designed to withstand meteors
he told my father who back then had a brush haircut
that made his ears stick out his moods
still full of passion still willing to listen
my mother with her beehive hairdo
smiling back at him all three of them
wanting so much to make the fine print
of the world work They laughed
and smoked and after they led the man
politely to the door my parents returned
to the living room and danced in the afternoon light
the phonograph playing Frank Sinatra
the green Buicks payments up to date
five-hundred dollars safely in the bank—
later that evening his infallible common sense
ready to protect us from a burst pipe or dry rot
my father waded up to his ankles in water
a V of sweat on the back of his shirt
Something loomed deeper than any basement
on our block larger than he was
a fear he could not admit was unsolvable
with a monkey wrench or a handshake and a little money down"

Whose doctor said his bipolar was pre-existing
Smacked in the head by a steel cargo door
hinges tied with a hamburger bag
The day he blew up a sucking silence mouth of tar
story told over and over

bump and rattle caissons rolling
The blacked-out school bus window is
scratched to read GHOST RECON Street signs flash by
“This here is Georgia Now I see New Hampshire
and here’s Colorado”What country is this city

Gorked on pain-relief cocktails Iraq to Landstuhl Med
to Andrews Air Force wheelchair bus to Walter Reed
Wounded when burning poppies now afloat
on morphine “As a state” he once emailed
“Afghanistan is next to Mars”

The navigator slides along a wall
“Sir can you show me north”
Where the gazebo is a tank Where the manhole covers a bomb
Who apologize for shaving cuts Skull plate
-lb gain from meds big ox baby

“Fall in” the heart-attack sergeant tells
the legless man “At ease” he tells the psychotics
They limp by drug dealers for their scoop
of Baskin-Robbins Are told
“Suck it up get used to the outside world”

Who are saved but die in dreams
salute with a mechanical arm

wrote that New World dampness and cold

Jefferson ordered Lewis amp Clark to find
a living Mammoth

the “animal de l’Ohio”
grazing somewhere west
of Big Bone Lick Kentucky and—
lest a species wither or Nation grow small—
brought Mammoth bones to Monticello

SECURITAS

Weary headlands roll through zones of night
red lights flash the muted streets
crotch-of-moss draining a blue spark dawn—
We sleep staring Tree-shapes and stars prod us
the belt of Orion is a martyr’s bomb

And the king our godsbody lies abed
groaning chill spirit belaboring the flesh—
His spit and sperm are tallied his temperature
a weather report told by doctors Until
lady Securitas peers from a cloud—

her bloodlined hands the blank bureaucratic face
We pray with our bodies cold sweat a hymn
of twitches heart racing shrieking dreams   
But fragrant Securitas has only
come for him—

To compass him about
Lifting out her breast
Stoppers his mouth with a thick nipple
Squeezing till the ichor throbs from his eyes
milk to make us thirsty—

she recalls Her scented unmarked body

sweats beneath foundation garments and paste
His unmarked body and fructifying breath
his stone squint chasing snakes from the sun—
They walk O my darling the hill of light
the bite of remorse teaches them to bite

no Frankenstein DNA They rewrite the Mammoth show

From Walter Reed “an aggressive campaign

Who wheels himself in to play Texas Hold ‘Em

Whose father says “It was OK for my son

if they lose weight except black menmen of other colors
and women of all colors have more gold but black men
are the summary of weight a lead thick thing on the scales
meters spinning until they ring off the end of the numbering
of accumulation how things grow heavy fish on the
ends of lines that become whales then prehistoric sea life
beyond all memories the billion days of human hands
working doing all the labor one can imagine hands
now the population of cactus leaves on a papyrus moon
waiting for the fire the notes from all their singing gone
up into the salt breath of tears of children that dry rise
up to be the crystalline canopy of promises the infinite
gone fishing days with the apologies for not being able to love
anymore gone down inside earth somewhere where
women make no demands have fewer dreams of forever
these feet that marched and ran and got cut off these hearts
torn out of chests by nameless thieves this thrashing
until the chaff is gone out and black men know the gold
of being the dead center of things where pain is the gateway
to Jerusalems Bodhi trees places for meditation and howling
keeping the weeping heads of gods in their eyes"
Rita Mae ReeseThe American on His First Honeymoon"What we can say has already been said
about each painting in the gallery—
about the quality of light the way she holds her head

So we are silent in the subway silent in bed
Our bodies too are mute we fall asleep knowing
what we could say has already been said

Over toast and coffee and the newspaper thoroughly read
the day unfolds between us I am too weak to carry
this quality of light the way she holds her head

I would vow to leave if love had left
if this were the wedding of two gypsies
But what should I say It has been said

the dead would properly bury the dead
and here I am alive at last and buried
by the quality of light and the way she holds her head

Perhaps women sex love are all over-rated
Which of us is the artist and which the light You see
the words I might say have been better said—
words concerning the quality of light the way you hold your head"
Eileen MylesAn American Poem"I was born in Boston in
 I never wanted
this fact to be known in
fact I’ve spent the better
half of my adult life
trying to sweep my early
years under the carpet
and have a life that
was clearly just mine
and independent of
the historic fate of
my family Can you
imagine what it was
like to be one of them
to be built like them
to talk like them
to have the benefits
of being born into such
a wealthy and powerful
American family I went
to the best schools
had all kinds of tutors
and trainers traveled
widely met the famous
the controversial and
the not-so-admirable
and I knew from
a very early age that
if there were ever any
possibility of escaping
the collective fate of this famous
Boston family I would
take that route and
I have I hopped
on an Amtrak to New
York in the early
‘s and I guess
you could say
my hidden years
began I thought
Well I’ll be a poet
What could be more
foolish and obscure
I became a lesbian
Every woman in my
family looks like
a dyke but it’s really
stepping off the flag
when you become one
While holding this ignominious
pose I have seen and
I have learned and
I am beginning to think
there is no escaping
history A woman I
am currently having
an affair with said
you know you look
like a Kennedy I felt
the blood rising in my
cheeks People have
always laughed at
my Boston accent
confusing “large” for
“lodge” “party”
for “potty” But
when this unsuspecting
woman invoked for
the first time my
family name
I knew the jig
was up Yes I am
I am a Kennedy
My attempts to remain
obscure have not served
me well Starting as
a humble poet I
quickly climbed to the
top of my profession
assuming a position of
leadership and honor
It is right that a
woman should call
me out now Yes
I am a Kennedy
And I await
your orders
You are the New Americans
The homeless are wandering
the streets of our nation’s
greatest city Homeless
men with AIDS are among
them Is that right
That there are no homes
for the homeless that
there is no free medical
help for these menAnd women
That they get the message
—as they are dying—
that this is not their home
And how are your
teeth today Can
you afford to fix them
How high is your rent
If art is the highest
and most honest form
of communication of
our times and the young
artist is no longer able
to move here to speak
to her time…Yes I could
but that was  years ago
and remember—as I must
I am a Kennedy
Shouldn’t we all be Kennedys
This nation’s greatest city
is home of the business-
man and home of the
rich artist People with
beautiful teeth who are not
on the streets What shall
we do about this dilemma
Listen I have been educated
I have learned about Western
Civilization Do you know
what the message of Western
Civilization is I am alone
Am I alone tonight
I don’t think so Am I
the only one with bleeding gums
tonight Am I the only
homosexual in this room
tonight Am I the only
one whose friends have
died are dying now
And my art can’t
be supported until it is
gigantic bigger than
everyone else’s confirming
the audience’s feeling that they are
alone That they alone
are good deserved
to buy the tickets
to see this Art
Are working
are healthy should
survive and are
normal Are you
normal tonight Everyone
here are we all normal
It is not normal for
me to be a Kennedy
But I am no longer
ashamed no longer
alone I am not
alone tonight because
we are all Kennedys
And I am your President"

Primus St JohnAmerican Roots Moral Associations" Kinship
Is embarrassing the wind
Like dead black boys
Falling down from the trees
Then downstream–
On their knees
Blood like

 Metaphor
Becomes humiliating
And clean
Ticking like a ripe machine
Do not
Bend
Fold
Or mutilate me–
This is your future speaking

 The air smells so metaphysical
We have accused it–
Of smog
And lost manhood
Then all ritual

 Whoever wrote
A view is a mountain speaking
But left the introduction
For the snow
And accused silence
Of its soul

 The whole nation
Is a stanza of blackness
A huge white whale
Faith in space
Like the newspapers
And the quiet insistence
We have peace
And it’s your world brother"
Matthew ZapruderAmerican Singer"In memory of  Vic Chesnutt
when I walk
to the mailbox
holding the letter
that fails to say
how sorry I am
you feel your call
or any words at all
on that day
would have stopped
the great singer
who long ago
decided more
quickly through
to move
I notice probably
because you wrote
that strange
word funeral
the constant black
fabric I think
is taffeta
always draped
over the scaffolds
the figures
scraping paint
are wearing dusty
protective suits
and to each other
saying nothing
I move invisibly
like a breeze
around three men
wearing advanced
practically weightless
jackets impervious
to all possible
weather even
a hurricane
I hear them say
something German
then photograph
the pale blue
turrets that floating
up in fog
seem noble
heads full
of important thoughts
like what revolution
could make us happy
from some window
wandering horns
he was three
when I was born
for a long time
I had no ideas
my father worked
in a private office
full of quiet
people working
I came to visit
it seemed correct
I went to college
studied things
dyed my hair
felt a rage
disguised as love
kept escaping
suffering only
a few broken bones
everything healed
now I live
in California
where in some
red and golden
theater I saw
him howl
such unfathomable
force from only
one lung
it was one
of  his last shows
in Athens once
many years
ago we shared
a cigarette
a little smoke
from our faces
I can’t remember
so many things
but see him
in his wheelchair
his folded body
it’s all gone
but for electrons
I can still push
into my ears
I choose the song
the perfect one
hear his words
and see
the mirror
in the ancient
lighthouse blinking
brave ships
somehow
you crossed
the water carrying
what we need
you can rest
light as nothing
in the harbor
we will take it
and go on"
Rita DoveAmerican Smooth"We were dancing—it must have
been a foxtrot or a waltz
something romantic but
requiring restraint
rise and fall precise
execution as we moved
into the next song without
stopping two chests heaving
above a seven-league
stride—such perfect agony
one learns to smile through
ecstatic mimicry
being the sine qua non
of American Smooth
And because I was distracted
by the effort of
keeping my frame
the leftward lean head turned
just enough to gaze out
past your ear and always
smiling smiling
I didn’t notice
how still you’d become until
we had done it
for two measures
four—achieved flight
that swift and serene
magnificence
before the earth
remembered who we were
and brought us down "

‘Tis dangerous to be good

--Lord Oxford
Deep in a vale a stranger now to arms
Too poor to shine in courts too proud to beg
He who once warred on Saratoga’s plains
Sits musing o’er his scars and wooden leg

Remembering still the toil of former days
To other hands he sees his earnings paid--
They share the due reward—he feeds on praise
Lost in the abyss of want misfortune’s shade

Far far from domes where splendid tapers glare
‘Tis his from dear bought peace no wealth to win
Removed alike from courtly cringing ‘squires
The great-man’s Levee and the proud man’s grin

Sold are those arms which once on Britons blazed
When flushed with conquest to the charge they came
That power repelled and Freedom’s fabrick raised
She leaves her soldier—famine and a name"
Grace SchulmanAmerican Solitude"“The cure for loneliness is solitude”
—Marianne Moore
Hopper never painted this but here
on a snaky path his vision lingers

three white tombs robots with glassed-in faces
and meters for eyes grim mouths flat noses

lean forward on a platform like strangers
with identical frowns scanning a blur

far off that might be their train
Gas tanks broken for decades face Parson’s

smithy planked shut now Both relics must stay
The pumps have roots in gas pools and the smithy

stores memories of hammers forging scythes
to cut spartina grass for dry salt hay

The tanks have the remove of local clammers
who sink buckets and stand never in pairs

but one and one and one blank-eyed alone
more serene than lonely Today a woman

rakes in the shallows then bends to receive
last rays in shimmering water her long shadow

knifing the bay She slides into her truck
to watch the sky flame over sand flats a hawk’s

wind arabesque an island risen brown
Atlantis at low tide she probes the shoreline

and beyond grassy dunes for where the land
might slope off into night Hers is no common

emptiness but a vaster silence filled
with terns’ cries an abundant solitude

Nearby the three dry gas pumps worn
survivors of clam-digging generations

are luminous and have an exile’s grandeur
that says In perfect solitude there’s fire

One day I approached the vessels
and wanted to drive on the road ablaze

with dogwood in full bloom but the contraptions
outdazzled the road’s white even outshone

a bleached shirt flapping alone
on a laundry line arms pointed down

High noon Three urns ironic in their outcast
dignity—as though like some pine chests

they might be prized in disuse—cast rays
spun leaf—covered numbers clanked then wheezed

and stopped again Shadows cut the road
before I drove off into the dark woods"

Where I am her son pent in blackness and turning the nights calm
Loose and letting the same blood fire through me In her bomb hair
Shells full of thunder in her mouth the fingers of some calamity

No music werent listening—and when I say it its like claiming
Shes an elegy It rhymes because of her with effigy Because of her

Gregory CorsoThe American Way"


I am a great American
I am almost nationalistic about it
I love America like a madness
But I am afraid to return to America
I’m even afraid to go into the American Express—





They are frankensteining Christ in America
in their Sunday campaigns
They are putting the fear of Christ in America
under their tents in their Sunday campaigns
They are driving old ladies mad with Christ in America
They are televising the gift of healing and the fear of hell
in America under their tents in their Sunday
campaigns
They are leaving their tents and are bringing their Christ
to the stadiums of America in their Sunday
campaigns
They are asking for a full house an all get out
for their Christ in the stadiums of America
They are getting them in their Sunday and Saturday
campaigns
They are asking them to come forward and fall on their
knees
because they are all guilty and they are coming
forward
in guilt and are falling on their knees weeping their
guilt
begging to be saved O Lord O Lord in their Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
and Sunday campaigns





It is a time in which no man is extremely wondrous
It is a time in which rock stupidity
outsteps the th Column as the sole enemy in America
It is a time in which ignorance is a good Ameri-cun
ignorance is excused only where it is so
it is not so in America
Man is not guiltyChrist is not to be feared
I am telling you the American Way is a hideous monster
eating Christmaking Him into Oreos and Dr Pepper
the sacrament of its foul mouth
I am telling you the devil is impersonating Christ in America
America’s educators amp preachers are the mental-dictators
of false intelligencethey will not allow America
to be smart
they will only allow death to make America smart
Educators amp communicators are the lackeys of the
American Way
They enslave the minds of the young
and the young are willing slaves but not for long
because who is to doubt the American Way
is not the way
The duty of these educators is no different
than the duty of a factory foreman
Replica productionmake all the young think alike
dress alikebelieve alikedo alike
Togethernessthis is the American Way
The few great educators in America are weak amp helpless
They abideand so uphold the American Way
Wars have seen such menthey who despised things about
them
but did nothingand they are the most dangerous
Dangerous because their intelligence is not denied
and so give faith to the young
who rightfully believe in their intelligence
Smoke this cigarette doctors smoke this cigarette
and doctors know

Educators knowbut they dare not speak their know
The victory that is man is made sad in this fix
Youth can only know the victory of being born
all else is stemmeduntil death be the final victory
and a merciful one at that
If America falls it will be the blame of its educators
preacherscommunicatorsalike
America today is America’s greatest threat
We are old when we are young
America is always newthe world is always new
The meaning of the world is birth not death
Growth gone in the wrong direction
The true direction grows ever young
In this direction what grows grows old
A strange mistakea strange and sad mistake
for it has grown into an old thing
while all else around it is new
Rockets will not make it any younger—
And what made America decide to grow
I do not knowI can only hold it to the strangeness in man
And America has grown into the American Way—
To be young is to be ever purposefullimitless
To grow is to know limitpurposelessness
Each age is a new age
How outrageous it is that something old and sad
from the pre-age incorporates each new age—
Do I say the Declaration of Independence is old
Yes I say what was good for  is not good for 
It was right and new to say all men were created equal
because it was a light then
But today it is tragic to say it
today it should be fact—
Man has been on earth a long time
One would think with his mania for growth
he would by now have outgrown such things as
constitutions manifestos codes commandments
that he could well live in the world without them
and know instinctively how to live and be
—for what is being but the facility to love
Was not that the true goal of growth love
Was not that Christ
But man is strange and grows where he will
and chalks it all up to Fatewhatever be—
America rings with such strangeness
It has grown into something strange and
the American is good example of this mad growth
The boy manbig baby meat
as though the womb were turned backwards
giving birth to an old man
The victory that is man does not allow man
to top off his empirical achievement with death
The Aztecs did it by yanking out young hearts
at the height of their power
The Americans are doing it by feeding their young to the
Way
For it was not the Spaniard who killed the Aztec
but the Aztec who killed the Aztec
Rome is proofGreece is proofall history is proof
Victory does not allow degeneracy
It will not be the Communists will kill America
nobut America itself—
The American Waythat sad mad process
is not run by any one man or organization
It is a monster born of itselfexisting of its self
The men who are employed by this monster
are employed unknowingly
They reside in the higher echelons of intelligence
They are the educators the psychiatrists the ministers
the writers the politicians the communicators
the rich the entertainment world
And some follow and sing the Way because they sincerely
believe it to be good
And some believe it holy and become minutemen in it
Some are in it simply to be in
And most are in it for gold
They do not see the Way as monster
They see it as the “Good Life”
What is the Way
The Way was born out of the American Dream
a nightmare—
The state of Americans today compared to the Americans
of the th century proves the nightmare—
Not Franklin not Jefferson who speaks for America today
but strange red-necked men of industry
and the goofs of show business
Bizarre Frightening The Mickey Mouse sits on the throne
and Hollywood has a vast supply—
Could grammar school youth seriously look upon
a picture of George Washington and “Herman Borst”
the famous night club comedian together at Valley
Forge
Old old and decadentgone the dignity
the American sun seems headed for the grave
O that youth might raise it anew
The future depends solely on the young
The future is the property of the young
What the young know the future will know
What they are and do the future will be and do
What has been done must not be done again
Will the American Way allow this
No
I see in every American Express
and in every army center in Europe
I see the same face the same sound of voice
the same clothes the same walk
I see mothers amp fathers
no difference among them
Replicas
They not only speak and walk and think alike
they have the same face
What did this monstrous thing
What regiments a people so
How strange is nature’s play on America
Surely were Lincoln alive today
he could never be voted Presidentnot with his
looks—
Indeed Americans are babies all in the embrace
of Mama Way
Did not Ike when he visited the American Embassy in
Paris a year ago say to the staff—“Everything is fine
just drink Coca Cola and everything will be all right”
This is true and is on record
Did not American advertising call for TOGETHERNESS
not orgiasticly like today’s call
nor as means to stem violence
This is true and is on record
Are not the army centers in Europe ghettos
They are and O how sadhow lost
The PX newsstands are filled with comic books
The army movies are always Doris Day
What makes a people huddle so
Why can’t they be universal
Who has smalled them so
This is serious I do not mock or hate this
I can only sense some mad vast conspiracy
Helplessness is all it is
They are caughtcaught in the Way—
And those who seek to get out of the Way
can not
The Beats are good example of this
They forsake the Way’s habits
and acquire for themselves their own habits
And they become as distinct and regimented and lost
as the main flow
because the Way has many outlets
like a snake of many tentacles—
There is no getting out of the Way
The only way out is the death of the Way
And what will kill the Way but a new consciousness
Something great and new and wonderful must happen
to free man from this beast
It is a beast we can not see or even understand
For it be the condition of our minds
God how close to science fiction it all seems
As if some power from another planet
incorporated itself in the minds of us all
It could well be
For as I live I swear America does not seem like America
to me

Americans are a great people
I ask for some great and wondrous event
that will free them from the Way
and make them a glorious purposeful people once
again
I do not know if that event is duedeserved
or even possible
I can only hold that man is the victory of life
And I hold firm to American man

I see standing on the skin of the Way
Americato be as proud and victorious as St
Michael on the neck of the fallen Lucifer—"

lilacs like turf stars

The late fawn
standing in his syrups

bucks down the swale
chewing sedge

We move south
to slopes of sleeping poppy

past the white alder
bending heads to scent

of calx—in natural dark

at belonging He
with greave of hide a born

hood lay with three
spikes in the clay green

peak in the breeze
He whose breathing

wrongs the still

William Butler YeatsAmong School Children"I

I walk through the long schoolroom questioning
A kind old nun in a white hood replies
The children learn to cipher and to sing
To study reading-books and history
To cut and sew be neat in everything
In the best modern way—the childrens eyes
In momentary wonder stare upon
A sixty-year-old smiling public man


II

I dream of a Ledaean body bent
Above a sinking fire a tale that she
Told of a harsh reproof or trivial event
That changed some childish day to tragedy—
Told and it seemed that our two natures blent
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy
Or else to alter Platos parable
Into the yolk and white of the one shell


III

And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
I look upon one child or tother there
And wonder if she stood so at that age—
For even daughters of the swan can share
Something of every paddlers heritage—
And had that colour upon cheek or hair
And thereupon my heart is driven wild
She stands before me as a living child


IV

Her present image floats into the mind—
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
And took a mess of shadows for its meat
And I though never of Ledaean kind
Had pretty plumage once—enough of that
Better to smile on all that smile and show
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow


V

What youthful mother a shape upon her lap
Honey of generation had betrayed
And that must sleep shriek struggle to escape
As recollection or the drug decide
Would think her son did she but see that shape
With sixty or more winters on its head
A compensation for the pang of his birth
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth

Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things
Solider Aristotle played the taws
Upon the bottom of a king of kings
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
What a star sang and careless Muses heard
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird

Both nuns and mothers worship images
But those the candles light are not as those
That animate a mothers reveries
But keep a marble or a bronze repose
And yet they too break hearts—O Presences
That passion piety or affection knows
And that all heavenly glory symbolise—
O self-born mockers of mans enterprise

Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul
Nor beauty born out of its own despair
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil
O chestnut tree great rooted blossomer
Are you the leaf the blossom or the bole
O body swayed to music O brightening glance
How can we know the dancer from the dance"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""For Eleanor
For seventeen years I was caught in the surf
Drubbed and scoured I’d snatch a breath
and be jerked down again dragged across
broken shells and shingle I loved it
mostly the need how I fed the frantic

I’d skipped into that sea Certainly not
a girl but I could still turn a head as I took
the foam between my thighs
Then it was over

Hiss of a match
snuffed with spit The sea had trotted off
I stood in the stink of flapping fish
At first it stung A galaxy of dimes
eyed my sag and crinkles and dismissed
me like a canceled stamp

but something tugged at me silver braids
weaving and unweaving themselves
and either the path was shrinking
or I was getting bigger for soon the way
was just a hair the extra bit of wit

a grandma leaves on her chin
to scare the boys and it led me
into a cave crackling like a woodstove
with laughter

A landslide opened
a seam of rubies and we stepped inside"
Robert BrowningAmong the Rocks"Oh good gigantic smile o’ the brown old earth
This autumn morning How he sets his bones
To bask i’ the sun and thrusts out knees and feet
For the ripple to run over in its mirth
Listening the while where on the heap of stones
The white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet

That is the doctrine simple ancient true
Such is life’s trial as old earth smiles and knows
If you loved only what were worth your love
Love were clear gain and wholly well for you
Make the low nature better by your throes
Give earth yourself go up for gain above"
Marie PonsotAmong Women"What women wander
Not many All A few
Most would now amp then
amp no wonder
Some and I’m one
Wander sitting still
My small grandmother
Bought from every peddler
Less for the ribbons and lace
Than for their scent
Of sleep where you will
Walk out when you want choose
Your bread and your company

She warned me “Have nothing to lose”

She looked fragile but had
High blood runner’s ankles
Could endure endure
She loved her rooted garden her
Grand children her once
Wild once young man
Women wander
As best they can"
Sandra LimAmor Fati"Inside every world there is another world trying to get out
and there is something in you that would like to discount this world

The stars could rise in darkness over heartbreaking coasts
and you would not know if you were ruining your life or beginning a real one

You could claim professional fondness for the world around you
the pictures would dissolve under the paint coming alive

and you would only feel a phantom skip of the heart absorbed so in the colors
Your disbelief is a later novel emerging in the long long shadow of an earlier one—

is this the great world which is whatever is the case
The sustained helplessness you feel in the long emptiness of days is matched

by the new suspiciousness and wrath you wake to each morning
Isn’t this a relationship with your death too to fall in love with your inscrutable life

Your teeth fill with cavities There is always unearned happiness for some
and the criminal feeling of solitude Always everyone lies about his life"
Jane HirshfieldAmor Fati"Little soul
you have wandered
lost a long time

The woods all dark now
birded and eyed

Then a light a cabin a fire a door standing open

The fairy tales warn you
Do not go in
you who would eat will be eaten

You go in You quicken

You want to have feet
You want to have eyes
You want to have fears"
Christina RossettiAmor Mundi"“Oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing
On the west wind blowing along this valley track”
“The downhill path is easy come with me an it please ye
We shall escape the uphill by never turning back”

So they two went together in glowing August weather
The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right
And dear she was to dote on her swift feet seemed to float on
The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight

“Oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven
Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt”
“Oh that’s a meteor sent us a message dumb portentous
An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt”

“Oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly
Their scent comes rich and sickly”—“A scaled and hooded worm”
“Oh what’s that in the hollow so pale I quake to follow”
“Oh that’s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term”

“Turn again O my sweetest—turn again false and fleetest
This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell’s own track”
“Nay too steep for hill-mounting nay too late for cost-counting
This downhill path is easy but there’s no turning back”"
Edgar BowersAmor Vincit Omnia"Love is no more
It died as the mind dies the pure desire
Relinquishing the blissful form it wore
The ample joy and clarity expire

Regret is vain
Then do not grieve for what you would efface
The sudden failure of the past the pain
Of its unwilling change and the disgrace

Leave innocence
And modify your nature by the grief
Which poses to the will indifference
That no desire is permanent in sense

Take leave of me
What recompense or pity or deceit
Can cure or what assumed serenity
Conceal the mortal loss which we repeat

The mind will change and change shall be relief"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti I Happy ye leaves when as those lilly hands"Happy ye leaves when as those lilly hands
Which hold my life in their dead doing might
Shall handle you and hold in loves soft bands
Lyke captives trembling at the victors sight
And happy lines on which with starry light
Those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
And reade the sorrowes of my dying spright
Written with teares in harts close bleeding book
And happy rymes bath’d in the sacred brooke
Of Helicon whence she derived is
When ye behold that Angels blessed looke
My soules long lacked foode my heavens blis
Leaves lines and rymes seeke her to please alone
Whom if ye please I care for other none"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti III The Sovereign Beauty"The sovereign beauty which I do admire
Witness the world how worthy to be praised
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire
In my frail spirit by her from baseness raised
That being now with her huge brightness dazed
Base thing I can no more endure to view
But looking still on her I stand amazed
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue
So when my tongue would speak her praises due
It stopped is with thoughts astonishment
And when my pen would write her titles true
It ravishd is with fancys wonderment
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write
The wonder that my wit cannot endite"

Edmund SpenserAmoretti LIV Of this worlds Theatre in which we stay"Of this worlds Theatre in which we stay
My love lyke the Spectator ydly sits
Beholding me that all the pageants play
Disguysing diversly my troubled wits
Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits
And mask in myrth lyke to a Comedy
Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits
I waile and make my woes a Tragedy
Yet she beholding me with constant eye
Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart
But when I laugh she mocks and when I cry
She laughes and hardens evermore her hart
What then can move her if not merth nor mone
She is no woman but a sencelesse stone"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti LV So oft as I her beauty do behold"So oft as I her beauty do behold
And therewith do her cruelty compare
I marvel of what substance was the mould
The which her made at once so cruel-fair
Not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are
Not water for her love doth burn like fire
Not air for she is not so light or rare
Not fire for she doth freeze with faint desire

Then needs another element inquire
Whereof she might be made that is the sky
For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire
And eke her love is pure immortal high
Then since to heaven ye likened are the best
Be like in mercy as in all the rest"
Edmund Spenser"Amoretti LXII  ""The weary yeare his race now having run""""The weary yeare his race now having run
The new begins his compast course anew
With shew of morning mylde he hath begun
Betokening peace and plenty to ensew
So let us which this chaunge of weather vew
Chaunge eeke our mynds and former lives amend
The old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew
And fly the faults with which we did offend
Then shall the new yeares joy forth freshly send
Into the glooming world his gladsome ray
And all these stormes which now his beauty blend
Shall turne to caulmes and tymely cleare away
So likewise love cheare you your heavy spright
And chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight"

With plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown
This one disparagement they to you gave
That ye your love lent to so meane a one
Yee whose high worths surpassing paragon
Could not on earth have found one fit for mate
Ne but in heaven matchable to none
Why did ye stoup unto so lowly state
But ye thereby much greater glory gate
Then had ye sorted with a princes pere
For now your light doth more it selfe dilate
And in my darknesse greater doth appeare
Yet since your light hath once enlumind me
With my reflex yours shall encreased be"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti LXVII Like as a Huntsman"Like as a huntsman after weary chase
Seeing the game from him escapd away
Sits down to rest him in some shady place
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey
So after long pursuit and vain assay
When I all weary had the chase forsook
The gentle deer returnd the self-same way
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook
There she beholding me with milder look
Sought not to fly but fearless still did bide
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied
Strange thing me seemd to see a beast so wild
So goodly won with her own will beguild"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti LXVIII Most Glorious Lord of Life"Most glorious Lord of life that on this day
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin
And having harrowd hell didst bring away
Captivity thence captive us to win
This joyous day dear Lord with joy begin
And grant that we for whom thou diddest die
Being with thy dear blood clean washd from sin
May live for ever in felicity
And that thy love we weighing worthily
May likewise love thee for the same again
And for thy sake that all like dear didst buy
With love may one another entertain
So let us love dear love like as we ought
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught"

Unless she doe him by the forelock take
Bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make
To wayt on love amongst his lovely crew
Where every one that misseth then her make
Shall be by him amearst with penance dew
Make hast therefore sweet love whilest it is prime

To speak her praise and glory excellent
Of all alive most worthy to be praised

Edmund SpenserAmoretti LXXIX Men Call you Fair"Men call you fair and you do credit it
For that your self ye daily such do see
But the true fair that is the gentle wit
And vertuous mind is much more praisd of me

Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue
But only that is permanent and free
From frail corruption that doth flesh ensue
That is true beauty that doth argue you
To be divine and born of heavenly seed
Derivd from that fair Spirit from whom all true
And perfect beauty did at first proceed
He only fair and what he fair hath made
All other fair like flowers untimely fade"
Edmund SpenserAmoretti LXXV One Day I Wrote her Name"One day I wrote her name upon the strand
But came the waves and washed it away
Again I wrote it with a second hand

For I myself shall like to this decay
And eke my name be wiped out likewise""

And in the heavens write your glorious name
Where whenas death shall all the world subdue
Our love shall live and later life renew"""

Fayre when the rose in her red cheekes appears
Or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke
Fayre when her brest lyke a rich laden barke
With pretious merchandize she forth doth lay
Fayre when that cloud of pryde which oft doth dark
Her goodly light with smiles she drives away
But fayrest she when so she doth display
The gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight
Throgh which her words so wise do make their way
To beare the message of her gentle spright
The rest be works of natures wonderment
But this the worke of harts astonishment"

For his returne that seemes to linger late
So I alone now left disconsolate
Mourne to my selfe the absence of my love
And wandring here and there all desolate
Seek with my playnts to match that mournful dove
Ne joy of ought that under heaven doth hove
Can comfort me but her owne joyous sight
Whose sweet aspèct both God and man can move
In her unspotted pleasauns to delight
Dark is my day whyles her fayre light I mis
And dead my life that wants such lively blis"
Edmund Spenser"Amoretti VIII More then most faire full of the living fire""More then most faire full of the living fire
Kindled above unto the maker neere

That to the world naught else be counted deare
Thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guest
Shoot out his darts to base affections wound
But Angels come to lead fraile mindes to rest
In chast desires on heavenly beauty bound
You frame my thoughts and fashion me within
You stop my toung and teach my hart to speake
You calme the storme that passion did begin
Strong thrugh your cause but by your vertue weak
Dark is the world where your light shined never
Well is he borne that may behold you ever"

Her minde remembreth her mortalitie
What so is fayrest shall to earth returne
But that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne
Base thing and thinke how she to heaven may clime
Treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne

Edmund SpenserAmoretti XXII This Holy Season"This holy season fit to fast and pray
Men to devotion ought to be inclind
Therefore I likewise on so holy day
For my sweet saint some service fit will find
Her temple fair is built within my mind
In which her glorious image placed is
On which my thoughts do day and night attend
Like sacred priests that never think amiss
There I to her as th author of my bliss
Will build an altar to appease her ire
And on the same my heart will sacrifice
Burning in flames of pure and chaste desire
The which vouchsafe O goddess to accept
Amongst thy dearest relics to be kept"

Th’ importune suit of my desire to shnone
For all that I in many dayes doo weave
In one short houre I find by her undonne
So when I thinke to end that I begonne
I must begin and never bring to end
For with one looke she spils that long I sponne
And with one word my whole years work doth rend
Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd
Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd"
Edmund Spenser"Amoretti XXX My Love is like to ice and I to fire""My Love is like to ice and I to fire
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire
But harder grows the more I her entreat
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat
And feel my flames augmented manifold
What more miraculous thing may be told
That fire which all things melts should harden ice
And ice which is congeal’d with senseless cold
Should kindle fire by wonderful device
Such is the power of love in gentle mind
That it can alter all the course of kind"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""Suppose I were to eat you
I should probably begin
with the fingers the cheeks and the breasts
yet all of you would tempt me
so powerfully spicy
as to discompose my choice

While I gobbled you up
delicacy by tidbit
I should lay the little bones
ever so gently round my plate
and caress the bigger bones
like ivory talismans

When I had quite devoured the edible you
your tongue informing my voice-box
I would wake in the groin of night
to feel ever so slowly
your plangent ravishing ghost
munching my fingers and toes

Here with an awkward delicate gesture
someone slides out his heart
and offers it on a spoon
garnished with adjectives"
Michael Drayton"Amour 
  
   Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee""Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee
That dangerous eye-killing cockatrice
The enchanting siren which doth so entice
The weeping crocodile—these vile pernicious three
The basilisk his nature takes from thee
Who for my life in secret wait dost lie
And to my heart sendst poison from thine eye
Thus do I feel the pain the cause yet cannot see
Fair-maid no more but Mer-maid be thy name
Who with thy sweet alluring harmony
Hast played the thief and stolen my heart from me
And like a tyrant makst my grief thy game
Thou crocodile who when thou hast me slain
Lamentst my death with tears of thy disdain"
John ReibetanzAmpersand"‘He thought it had only been put there
to finish off th’ alphabet like though
ampus-and amp would ha’ done as well’
George Eliot Adam Bede
And had in fact for generations—
the plump open armed ‘amp’ waving goodbye
from the end of the old-world alphabet
like an innkeeper framed in doorway candlelight
farewells swelled with hopes of come again

Then the old world burned down
because we sensed beyond the candle’s glow
the road led to a dead end No
traveler returned even the unverified
odd reports of happy returns petered out

So we renovated the alphabet signing it
off with a streamlined ‘z’ as sharp
and final as lightning no sense
in posting notice of further connections
that didn’t exist or passing off maps as places

Trouble was nobody felt at home
in the revamped compound Bookings fell off
postcards of views of blank walls piled unsold
in the unvisited gift shop the same
paperbacks stalled on the revolving racks

It was a paradise of sorts a golden age
of nullity no relatives
breaking the costly silence No wonder Eliot’s
befuddled Jacob Storey felt his page
of Z’s was somehow ‘not right’ that

‘it was a letter you never wanted hardly’
He knew as one newly released from the unlit
cell of his long-unlettered ignorance
what you did want hardly you wanted
needed—as hardly as Hetty Sorrel

abandoned at the dock—someone to stand by
You were the murderess of your baby
silenced with a ‘z’ You needed a hand
the open-armed return of all your relations
You wanted harder than death ampersand"

We looked together at some ludicrous large leaf — larger than us
both and thicker even than several large ampersands together
We used thick language to describe it then

Built huts with cots and plots of land for farms We grew ampersands
there and ate them and when through with their husks threw them

Donald Grady DavidsonThe Amulet"Thou twist of gold woven so curiously
Be filled with warmth and urgent tenderness
And cool not on her throat’s white nakedness
Like metal death but burn insistently
Reminding her of me

To save her from the serpent’s little eye
I set a stone of blue chalcedony
Within a cunning loop—so it shall be
Aware and mindful when her lashes lie
Untaught of danger nigh

To keep her from the dragon’s hungry tooth
In seven laps the quorls were subtly twined
From seven rivers grains of gold were mined
Hammered by black elves’ mauls and tempered sooth
In hissing brews uncouth

So lie within my satchel Amulet
With many another dull and boughten thing
Till I am done with all my wandering
And fix thee pendant on the carcanet
Around her white neck set

For I have graven some small incantation
In feathery lines upon this rounded wire—
King Solomon made such for his desire
And Sheba’s throat was warm for subjugation
Hearing the King’s translation"
Jordan DavisAmuse-Bouche"I miss the moshpit pushed to the side of the bed
The hard and fast rules the business
Walking across town the baby’s hand in mine
Gave me anxiety Rosado barely mellowed

Who doesn’t love to hear about anxiety
You wouldn’t be too wrong to wake from dreaming
Into an amusement park sluice of Rioja
Eau de post-Auden thanks a lot Timex hubbub

Those feelings are in their way good luck
I don’t even need a communion wafer
To feel the need to broadcast imprecations
Fade like a docent as the hedge fund falls"
Carolyn KizerAmusing Our Daughters"after Po Chü-i
for Robert Creeley
We don’t lack people here on the Northern coast
But they are people one meets not people one cares for
So I bundle my daughters into the car
And with my brother poets go to visit you brother

Here come your guests A swarm of strangers and children
But the strangers write verses the children are daughters like yours
We bed down on mattresses cots roll up on the floor
Outside burly old fruit trees in mist and rain
In every room bundles asleep like larvae

We waken and count our daughters Otherwise nothing happens
You feed them sweet rolls and melon drive them all to the zoo
Patiently patiently ever the father you answer their questions
Later we eat again drink listen to poems
Nothing occurs though we are aware you have three daughters
Who last year had four But even death becomes part of our ease
Poems parenthood sorrow all we have learned
From these of tenderness holds us together
In the center of life entertaining daughters
By firelight with cake and songs

You my brother are a good and violent drinker
Good at reciting short-line or long-line poems
In time we will lose all our daughters you and I
Be temperate venerable content to stay in one place
Sending our messages over the mountains and waters"

Yea thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine
Except these kisses of my lips on thine
Brand them with immortality but me –
Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea
Nor mix their hearts with music nor behold
Cast forth of heaven with feet of awful gold
And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind
Lightning with thunder for a hound behind
Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown
But in the light and laughter in the moan
And music and in grasp of lip and hand
And shudder of water that makes felt on land
The immeasurable tremor of all the sea
Memories shall mix and metaphors of me"

then Elvis really Lives
and Princess Diana foretold I end as car spin

If you believe the letters themselves
contain a power within them
then you understand
what makes outside tedious
how desperation becomes a rope ends it

The circular logic that allows senator to become treason
and treason to become atoners

That eleven plus two is twelve plus one
and an admirer is also married

That if you could just rearrange things the right way
you’d find your true life
the right path the answer to your questions
you’d understand how the Titanic

How listen is the same as silent

Tacey M AtsittyAnasazi"How can we die when were already
prone to leaving the table mid-meal
like Ancient Ones gone to breathe
elsewhere Salt sits still but peppers gone
rolled off in a rush Weve practiced dying
for a long time when we skip dance or town
when we chew Weve rounded out
like dining room walls in a canyon eaten
through by wind—Sorry we rushed off
the food wasnt ours Sorry the grease sits
white on our plates and the jam that didnt set—
use it as syrup to cover every theory of us"
John Peck"Anasazi Ancient Enemies""I rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper
From the rock face footed a dancer white through red
My family gave me over
to it gone for the river

Were I a peasant harvesting grapes near Beaune
in the last century even I might have dreamed
a saint lifting off for Arles
Les Saintes Maries de la Mer

and knowing about cannon in that long peace
might have been troubled therefore that my flier
hauled a magnum of the best
and bloodied the west sky with it

and vanished My fisting that loose sheet in place
was secretarial not visionary
Already in that decade
small tribes entered the void

like windows on a skyscraper when the bent
janitor makes his way But those flick back on
each night costly difference
It is not only portents

in dream or flapping images of the gone
or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised
that catch like undertow
the foot in tide-rip toeing

down the singing or remembered beach
We study populations in the forests
we hold the paper flat
mark note warn—the dictated

prophecies do their work we do some work—
cut horn from rhinos so they won’t be poached
But to go on from there
one needs to stand in the doorway

some evening and feel the air as if it were fire
pulling illusionlessly letting the draw
of one fact heat its chain
of links such as Japan

clear-cutting forests in Siberia
where tigers not already harvested
lope their dwindling range
two hundred as the hinge

for their growled arc of existence bones of the others
ground to powders for old men’s potencies
One needs to feel the tug
of the draft on skin the drag

of process utterly anciently itself
Faster now the pull is from birth through dwelling through
dissolution along lines
streaming through us ageless winds"
Cate MarvinAnathema"I never recline in splendor
I never take repose The eyes
of an old woman are blue
and stick to me like insects to
a screen She is not hating me
though there are those who hate me
so I never lie in repose for fear
that if I agree with the vulnerability
of sleep Ill make my own murder

I dont embrace the unconscious
or analyze my dreams The eyes
of people who hate me might be
spiders crawling on my hands
or snails that leave their shells
but I will not allow their acidic
tounges to touch me I belive
in ghosts only now that her blue
eyes stick to me like humidity

I will not outgrow my spite
though I read books that instruct
me to No Ill always lie with my
sleep beside me like a knife
I forgot my spite once only
to wish I had not He lay me
upon the bed crossed my arms
across my chest then fell to me
pressing a book between us

I never lie in repose I am not
a portrait But I think so still
my joints ache One day he
shall not be the same as I have
never been the same and we
shall read upon his stone a verse
attributed to my name This
is my foresight and my fright
blooming red in his eyes white"

Unfastened avidly from each ivory button
of her spine the voluntary muscles open
virtuosities of red Cinnabar

the mutagen and carmine from cochineal

robes soaked in its thousands Sunsets
of other centuries fade in galleries to ash
Red is fugitive As the voice the blow

of gravity along a nerve opening to an ache
the body can’t unhouse As the carnation
suffusing cheek and haunch like saucers

from the king’s porcelain rinsed in candlelight
Gratuitous as the curl the urn-shaped torso
the pensive brimming gaze of pretty

post-coital thought she half-turns over one

Robert WrigleyAnatomy of Melancholy"Lucy Doolin first day on the job stroked his goatee
and informed the seven of us in his charge
his name was short for Lucifer and that his father a man
he never knew had been possessed
as his mother had told him of both an odd sense of humor
and a deep and immitigable bitterness Also
that the same man had named Lucy’s twin brother
born dead Jesus Christ These facts he said
along with his tattoos and Mohawked black hair
we should in our toils on his behalf remember

As we should also always remember to call him
only by that otherwise most womanly diminutive
and never he warned by his given nor surname
least of all with the title “Mister” attached
which would remind him of that same most hated father
and plunge him therefore into a mood
he could not promise he would he said “behave
appropriately within” Fortunately our job
unlike the social difficulties attached thereto
was simple collect the trash from the county’s back roads

Although given Lucy’s insistence on thoroughness
this meant not only beer cans and bottles
all manner of cast-off paper and plastics but also
the occasional condom too as well as the festering
roadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry
or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tar
with a square-bladed shovel all of which was to be tossed
into the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselves
rode to and from the job in By fifty-yard increments
then we traveled He was never not smoking a cigarette

Late every afternoon at the dump while we unloaded
our tonnage of trash he sat with Stump McCarriston
sexton of the dump and the dump’s constant resident
in the shade next to a green decrepit trailer
we marveled at and strangely envied since every inch
of wall we could see through the open door
was plastered with fold-outs and pages
from every Stump-salvaged Playboy and nudie magazine
he had ever found among the wreckage there
Stump we understood was the ugliest man on earth

Even had Lucy not told us so we would have known
by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yards
of his hovel that he never bathed And once
while we shoveled and scraped he took up the 
from the rack beside his door and popped
with amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us
then walked to their carcasses skinned them out
and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rack
to dry He was making Lucy explained a rat hide
coat we could see come the fall except for school

As for school it was a concept Stump could not fathom
and Lucy had no use for on the truck’s dash
all that summer Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy
a tome he said he’d read already eleven times
this summer being the twelfth We thought in some way
it might have had to do with something like the gallery
Stump’s trailer contained the first word of its title
meaning something to us the last nothing at all
There were things about men we might be
unable ever to know which we somehow knew was lucky

And Lucky incidentally was the name of the cat
fat and mangy that once Stump was back in the shade
with Lucy began one by one to consume the hideless rats
The town we came from was sinking into the emptiness
of a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it
and rats were more common than hares
and universally despised They shamed us it seemed
as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity—
the bodies of those women on the walls the provenance
of rats the very earth offered up like a plague

the burden of a name like Lucifer or Stump
whose name as it was scrawled on his mailbox
seemed to be Stumplin Reilly McCarriston Esquire
Of the seven of us one would die in Vietnam
one after medical school would hang himself
from a beam in his parents’ basement the others
merely gone vanished in actuality if not in memory
Leaving me alone to tell this story How Stump
would spend his last twenty years in prison
having shot Lucy—one slender flattening  slug

through the forehead—as he stood fifty feet away
balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer
arms extended like Jesus Christ said Stump
whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itself
even before the trial and who no doubt by some
court-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself
was forced to bathe and shave to step into the unknown country
of a scentless white shirt and black businessman’s trousers
in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense
that Lucifer—Mr Doolin as the court insisted—had told him to"
John DonneAn Anatomy of the World"excerpt

AN ANATOMY OF THE WORLD
Wherein
by occasion of the untimely death of Mistress
Elizabeth Drury the frailty and the decay
of this whole world is represented
THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY
When that rich soul which to her heaven is gone
Whom all do celebrate who know they have one
For who is sure he hath a soul unless
It see and judge and follow worthiness
And by deeds praise it He who doth not this
May lodge an inmate soul but tis not his
When that queen ended here her progress time
And as ther standing house to heaven did climb
Where loath to make the saints attend her long
Shes now a part both of the choir and song
This world in that great earthquake languished
For in a common bath of tears it bled
Which drew the strongest vital spirits out
But succourd then with a perplexed doubt
Whether the world did lose or gain in this
Because since now no other way there is
But goodness to see her whom all would see
All must endeavour to be good as she
This great consumption to a fever turnd
And so the world had fits it joyd it mournd
And as men think that agues physic are
And th ague being spent give over care
So thou sick world mistakst thy self to be
Well when alas thourt in a lethargy
Her death did wound and tame thee then and then
Thou mightst have better spard the sun or man
That wound was deep but tis more misery
That thou hast lost thy sense and memory
Twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan
But this is worse that thou art speechless grown
Thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst thou wast
Nothing but she and her thou hast oerpast
For as a child kept from the font until
A prince expected long come to fulfill
The ceremonies thou unnamd hadst laid
Had not her coming thee her palace made
Her name defind thee gave thee form and frame
And thou forgetst to celebrate thy name
Some months she hath been dead but being dead
Measures of times are all determined
But long sheath been away long long yet none
Offers to tell us who it is thats gone
But as in states doubtful of future heirs
When sickness without remedy impairs
The present prince theyre loath it should be said
""The prince doth languish"" or ""The prince is dead""
So mankind feeling now a general thaw
A strong example gone equal to law
The cement which did faithfully compact
And glue all virtues now resolvd and slackd
Thought it some blasphemy to say shwas dead
Or that our weakness was discovered
In that confession therefore spoke no more
Than tongues the soul being gone the loss deplore
But though it be too late to succour thee
Sick world yea dead yea putrified since she
Thy intrinsic balm and thy preservative
Can never be renewd thou never live
I since no man can make thee live will try
What we may gain by thy anatomy
Her death hath taught us dearly that thou art
Corrupt and mortal in thy purest part
Let no man say the world itself being dead
Tis labour lost to have discovered
The worlds infirmities since there is none
Alive to study this dissection
For theres a kind of world remaining still
Though she which did inanimate and fill
The world be gone yet in this last long night
Her ghost doth walk that is a glimmering light
A faint weak love of virtue and of good
Reflects from her on them which understood
Her worth and though she have shut in all day
The twilight of her memory doth stay
Which from the carcass of the old world free
Creates a new world and new creatures be
Producd The matter and the stuff of this
Her virtue and the form our practice is
And though to be thus elemented arm
These creatures from home-born intrinsic harm
For all assumd unto this dignity
So many weedless paradises be
Which of themselves produce no venomous sin
Except some foreign serpent bring it in
Yet because outward storms the strongest break
And strength itself by confidence grows weak
This new world may be safer being told
The dangers and diseases of the old
For with due temper men do then forgo
Or covet things when they their true worth know
There is no health physicians say that we
At best enjoy but a neutrality
And can there be worse sickness than to know
That we are never well nor can be so
We are born ruinous poor mothers cry
That children come not right nor orderly
Except they headlong come and fall upon
An ominous precipitation
How wittys ruin how importunate
Upon mankind It labourd to frustrate
Even Gods purpose and made woman sent
For mans relief cause of his languishment
They were to good ends and they are so still
But accessory and principal in ill
For that first marriage was our funeral
One woman at one blow then killd us all
And singly one by one they kill us now
We do delightfully our selves allow
To that consumption and profusely blind
We kill our selves to propagate our kind
And yet we do not that we are not men
There is not now that mankind which was then
When as the sun and man did seem to strive
Joint tenants of the world who should survive
When stag and raven and the long-livd tree
Compard with man died in minority
When if a slow-pacd star had stoln away
From the observers marking he might stay
Two or three hundred years to seet again
And then make up his observation plain
When as the age was long the size was great
Mans growth confessd and recompensd the meat
So spacious and large that every soul
Did a fair kingdom and large realm control
And when the very stature thus erect
Did that soul a good way towards heaven direct
Where is this mankind now Who lives to age
Fit to be made Methusalem his page
Alas we scarce live long enough to try
Whether a true-made clock run right or lie
Old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow
And for our children we reserve tomorrow
So short is life that every peasant strives
In a torn house or field to have three lives
And as in lasting so in length is man
Contracted to an inch who was a span
For had a man at first in forests strayd
Or shipwrackd in the sea one would have laid
A wager that an elephant or whale
That met him would not hastily assail
A thing so equall to him now alas
The fairies and the pigmies well may pass
As credible mankind decays so soon
Weare scarce our fathers shadows cast at noon
Only death adds tour length nor are we grown
In stature to be men till we are none
But this were light did our less volume hold
All the old text or had we changd to gold
Their silver or disposd into less glass
Spirits of virtue which then scatterd was
But tis not so ware not retird but dampd
And as our bodies so our minds are crampd
Tis shrinking not close weaving that hath thus
In mind and body both bedwarfed us
We seem ambitious Gods whole work tundo
Of nothing he made us and we strive too
To bring our selves to nothing back and we
Do what we can to dot so soon as he
With new diseases on our selves we war
And with new physic a worse engine far
Thus man this worlds vice-emperor in whom
All faculties all graces are at home
And if in other creatures they appear
Theyre but mans ministers and legates there
To work on their rebellions and reduce
Them to civility and to mans use
This man whom God did woo and loath tattend
Till man came up did down to man descend
This man so great that all that is is his
O what a trifle and poor thing he is
If man were anything hes nothing now
Help or at least some time to waste allow
This other wants yet when he did depart
With her whom we lament he lost his heart
She of whom thancients seemd to prophesy
When they calld virtues by the name of she
She in whom virtue was so much refind
That for alloy unto so pure a mind
She took the weaker sex she that could drive
The poisonous tincture and the stain of Eve
Out of her thoughts and deeds and purify
All by a true religious alchemy
She she is dead shes dead when thou knowest this
Thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is
And learnst thus much by our anatomy
The heart being perishd no part can be free
And that except thou feed not banquet on
The supernatural food religion
Thy better growth grows withered and scant
Be more than man or thourt less than an ant
Then as mankind so is the worlds whole frame
Quite out of joint almost created lame
For before God had made up all the rest
Corruption entred and depravd the best
It seizd the angels and then first of all
The world did in her cradle take a fall
And turnd her brains and took a general maim
Wronging each joint of thuniversal frame
The noblest part man felt it first and then
Both beasts and plants cursd in the curse of man
So did the world from the first hour decay
That evening was beginning of the day
And now the springs and summers which we see
Like sons of women after fifty be
And new philosophy calls all in doubt
The element of fire is quite put out
The sun is lost and thearth and no mans wit
Can well direct him where to look for it
And freely men confess that this worlds spent
When in the planets and the firmament
They seek so many new they see that this
Is crumbled out again to his atomies
Tis all in pieces all coherence gone
All just supply and all relation
Prince subject father son are things forgot
For every man alone thinks he hath got
To be a phoenix and that then can be
None of that kind of which he is but he
This is the worlds condition now and now
She that should all parts to reunion bow
She that had all magnetic force alone
To draw and fasten sundred parts in one
She whom wise nature had invented then
When she observd that every sort of men
Did in their voyage in this worlds sea stray
And needed a new compass for their way
She that was best and first original
Of all fair copies and the general
Steward to fate she whose rich eyes and breast
Gilt the West Indies and perfumd the East
Whose having breathd in this world did bestow
Spice on those Isles and bade them still smell so
And that rich India which doth gold inter
Is but as single money coind from her
She to whom this world must it self refer
As suburbs or the microcosm of her
She she is dead shes dead when thou knowst this
Thou knowst how lame a cripple this world is"
Carolyn ForchéAncapagari"In the morning of the tribe this name Ancapagari was given to these mountains The name then alive spread into the world and never returned Ancapagari no foot-step ever spoken no mule deer killed from its foothold left for dead Ancapagari opened the stones Pine roots gripped peak rock with their claws Water dug into the earth and vanished boiling up again in another place The water was bitten by aspen generations of aspen shot their light colored trunks into space Ancapagari At that time if the whisper was in your mouth you were lighted

Now these people are buried The root-taking finished Buried in everything thousands taken root The roots swell nesting Openings widen for the roots to surface

They sway within you in steady wind of your breath You are forever swinging between this being and another one being and another There is a word for it crawling in your mouth each night Speak it

Ancapagari has circled returned to these highlands The yellow pines deathless the sparrow hawks scull the waters are going numb Ancapagari longs to be spoken in each tongue It is the name of the god who has come from among us"
Jimmy Santiago BacaAncestor"It was a time when they were afraid of him
My father a bare man a gypsy a horse
with broken knees no one would shoot
Then again he was like the orange tree
and young women plucked from him sweet fruit
To meet him you must be in the right place
even his sons and daughter we wondered
where was papa now and what was he doing
He held the mystique of travelers
that pass your backyard and disappear into the trees
Then when you follow you find nothing
not a stir not a twig displaced from its bough
And then he would appear one night
Half covered in shadows and half in light
his voice quiet absorbing our unspoken thoughts
When his hands lay on the table at breakfast
they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home
hands that had not taken us into them
and the fingers did not gently rub along our lips
They were hands of a gypsy that filled our home
with love and safety for a moment
with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs
they filled us because of the love in them
Beyond the ordinary love beyond the coordinated life
beyond the sponging of broken hearts
came the untimely word the fallen smile the quiet tear
that made us grow up quick and romantic
Papa gave us something when we paused from work
my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields
my brother and I running like deer
we would pause because we had a papa no one could catch
who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank
he bragged about us he did not say we were smart
nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday
He said we were good He held us up to the world for it to see
three children that were good who understood love in a quiet way
who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom
and that is how he made us he offered us to the wind
to the mountains to the skies of autumn and spring
He said “Here are my children Care for them”
And he left again going somewhere like a child
with a warrior’s heart nothing could stop him
My grandmother would look at him for a long time
and then she would say nothing
She chose to remain silent praying each night
guiding down like a root in the heart of earth
clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast
And I am the blossom of many nights
A threefold blossom my sister is as she is
my brother is as he is and I am as I am
Through sacred ceremony of living daily living
arose three distinct hopes three loves
out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday"
Afaa Michael WeaverThe Ancestors Explain How Envy Grew"Calm appeared his soul stopped a crow
staring as he snatched down miniature angels
trapped them in jars capping the light away
to make a hush out of glory songs a crying out
from the joyful aubades they breathe as easy
as moonlight on jars of preserves their throats
full of fear now the brave breast crumpled
in his child fingers their prisons invisible
to the cherubim searching for heavens missing
songsters trapped in blind ways of getting even
at a world that would make him small make
him an impotent wonder curl his genius under
like a witchs toes when his father died
chewing on cheese and cornbread chocolate
surprise in the sun an unkind ending

He grew in the way of genius no charts
showing where he ended and the world began
how cities figure in the jagged sweep of cornfields
endless thousands of shouts up into the evening
listening to the future speaking like the old man
in the schoolyard a stranger by the wishing pond
in the woods or dogs that stand up like men in hats—
these the Corinthian signs he mistook
for an alphabet giving the right to molest children
Now wisdom is sour rubbing medicine pasted
over nightmares not the proper wealth of an old man
the arms of his neighbors around him like laurels"
Archibald MacLeishAncestral"The star dissolved in evening—the one star
The silently
and night O soon now soon
And still the light now
and still now the large
Relinquishing
and through the pools of blue
Still still the swallows
and a wind now
and the tree
Gathering darkness
I was small I lay
Beside my mother on the grass and sleep
Came—

slow hooves and dripping with the dark
The velvet muzzles the white feet that move
In a dream water
and O soon now soon
Sleep and the night

And I was not afraid
Her hand lay over mine Her fingers knew
Darkness—and sleep—the silent lands the far
Far off of morning where I should awake"
David FerryAncestral Lines"It’s as when following the others’ lines
Which are the tracks of somebody gone before
Leaving me mischievous clues telling me who

They were and who it was they weren’t
And who it is I am because of them
Or just for the moment reading them I am

Although the next moment I’m back in myself and lost
My father at the piano saying to me
“Listen to this he called the piece Warum”

And the nearest my father could come to saying what
He made of that was lamely to say he didn’t
Schumann didn’t my father didn’t know why

“What’s in a dog’s heart” I once asked in a poem
And Christopher Ricks when he read it said “Search me”
He wasn’t just being funny he was right

You can’t tell anything much about who you are
By exercising on the Romantic bars
What are the wild waves saying I don’t know

And Shelley didn’t know and knew he didn’t
In his great poem “Ode to the West Wind” he
Said that the leaves of his pages were blowing away

Dead leaves like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing"
Seán HewittAncestry"The damp had got its grip years ago
but gone unnoticed The heads of the joists
feathered slowly in the cavity wall
and the room’s wet belly had begun to bow

Once we’d ripped the boards up it all came out
the smell at first then the crumbling wood
gone to seed all its muscles wasted
You pottered back and to with tea soda bread

eighty years shaking on a plastic tray
One by one we looked up nodded then slipped
under the floor We moved down there like fish
in moonlight or divers round an old ship"
Edwin MarkhamAnchored to the Infinite"The builder who first bridged Niagara’s gorge
Before he swung his cable shore to shore
Sent out across the gulf his venturing kite
Bearing a slender cord for unseen hands
To grasp upon the further cliff and draw
A greater cord and then a greater yet
Till at the last across the chasm swung
The cable then the mighty bridge in air

So we may send our little timid thought
Across the void out to God’s reaching hands—
Send out our love and faith to thread the deep—
Thought after thought until the little cord
Has greatened to a chain no chance can break
And we are anchored to the Infinite"
Siegfried SassoonAncient History"Adam a brown old vulture in the rain
Shivered below his wind-whipped olive-trees
Huddling sharp chin on scarred and scraggy knees
He moaned and mumbled to his darkening brain
‘He was the grandest of them all—was Cain
‘A lion laired in the hills that none could tire
‘Swift as a stag a stallion of the plain
‘Hungry and fierce with deeds of huge desire’

Grimly he thought of Abel soft and fair—
A lover with disaster in his face
And scarlet blossom twisted in bright hair
‘Afraid to fight was murder more disgrace 
‘God always hated Cain’ He bowed his head—
The gaunt wild man whose lovely sons were dead"
Robert Fernandez"And

Help us not become wards of the state
impoverished homeless destitute crushed
under the heel buried in systems imprisoned
dead hospitalized We die die die Our dogs

bright ribbons of work tangled in our bodies

Natalie ShaperoAnd Also with You"The comet taught us how to watch the war
The comet contended that fire

Was the comet simply endeavoring
to keep us divided I asked it and the comet

did not reply Then we discovered the men
who wanted us dead
were convening at night on the site where their hero

interred And so we exhumed the guy burned him up

Mary Jo BangAnd as in Alice"Alice cannot be in the poem she says because
Shes only a metaphor for childhood
And a poem is a metaphor already
So wed only have a metaphor

Inside a metaphor Do you see
They all nod They see Except for the girl
With her head in the rabbit hole From this vantage
Her bum looks like the flattened backside

Of  a black and white panda She actually has one
In the crook of  her arm
Of course its stuffed and not living
Who would dare hold a real bear so near the outer ear

Shes wondering what possible harm might come to her
If  she fell all the way down the dark shes looking through
Would strange creatures sing songs
Where odd syllables came to a sibilant end at the end

Perhaps the sounds would be a form of  light  hissing
Like when a walrus blows air
Through two fractured front teeth Perhaps it would
Take the form of a snake But if a snake it would need a tree

Could she grow one from seed Could one make a cat
Make it sit on a branch and fade away again
The moment you told it that the rude noise it was hearing was
rational thought
With an axe beating on the forest door"
Frederick Goddard Tuckerman"“And Change with hurried hand has swept these scenes”""from
Sonnets Second Series


XVIII

And Change with hurried hand has swept these scenes
The woods have fallen across the meadow-lot
The hunter’s trail and trap-path is forgot
And fire has drunk the swamps of evergreens
Yet for a moment let my fancy plant
These autumn hills again—the wild dove’s haunt
The wild deer’s walk In golden umbrage shut
The Indian river runs Quonecktacut
Here but a lifetime back where falls to-night
Behind the curtained pane a sheltered light
On buds of rose or vase of violet
Aloft upon the marble mantel set—
Here in the forest-heart hung blackening
The wolf-bait on the bush beside the spring"
Geoffrey Brock"And Day Brought Back My Night
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""It was so simple you came back to me
And I was happy Nothing seemed to matter
But that That you had gone away from me
And lived for days with him—it didn’t matter
That I had been left to care for our old dog
And house alone—couldn’t have mattered less
On all this you and I and our happy dog
Agreed We slept The world was worriless

I woke in the morning brimming with old joys
Till the fact-checker showed up late for work
And started inItem it’s years not days
Item you had no dog Item she isn’t back
In fact she just remarried And oh yes item you
Left her remember"
Hilda MorleyAnd I in My Bed Again"Last night
tossed in
my bed
the sound of the rain turned me
around
a leaf
in a dried gully
from side to
side
the sound of the rain took me
apart opened to what is it
breath caught in memory of
a deep sweetness
that sound
unceasing
delicate the wetness running
through my body
It might be nighttime
in a forest hut
the rain constant
in little rivulets
splashing
at times uncertain—
safe in each others arms
the rain sheltering
us a depth opening
bottomless to a terrible sweetness
the small rain
shaking us in our bed
the terror
whispering
End of a season
wind from the west

Fran LockAnd I will consider the yellow dog"And Smart saw God concentric in his cat
Smart’s cat artificing faith from cyclone
volition There is no God in you yellow
dog Your breath is our daily quicksand
you juggle your legs into an avid heap
You are bent on death There is no God
in you You are imperfect and critterly
I will consider you for all of that Today
as you joust farewell to the park the pack
in their garrison palsy tails agog and you
cocking your head to cup Madam’s strewn
bark your nose like an antique brooch
in the sun I will consider you yellow dog
as you twist in a rapt mechanical dream
I will consider your coat the color
of fenced gold how you are your own
secular halo I will consider your skull
the narrow skull of a young gazelle
whose victory is leaping And I will
consider your eyes their hazel light
a gulp of fire those firewater eyes
holding now a numb depth down
and milkier flickering monthly I will
consider your youth when we didn’t
know if you would saunter or quake
when we didn’t know if you
would prove savvy or giddy or both
It was both Our frank amaze at your hardy
smarts Our silly delight at each degree
of more-than-human knowing I will
consider you yellow dog your pale
moods and your gazing your fidgets
and your snoozes There is no God in you
the deep-time of a dog year is enough
And lately you are wiser than all zero
Dear dog creaking like a haunted house
I will consider you from bucking young
’un to patient as settling porter how you
held the pack when Fat Man was small
and a zoomy nuisance of wriggling I will
consider your narrow self aslant against
my chest in grief in grieving overwhelmed
when you were the busy broom that swept
the pieces of me together Yes I will
consider the yellow dog his bestowing
snout in the chill am his royal cheek
and his dances A yellow dog comes only
once and is hisself brilliant final and entire"
George Gascoigne"And If I Did What Then""“And if I did what then
Are you aggriev’d therefore
The sea hath fish for every man
And what would you have more”

Thus did my mistress once
Amaze my mind with doubt
And popp’d a question for the nonce
To beat my brains about

Whereto I thus replied
“Each fisherman can wish
That all the seas at every tide
Were his alone to fish

“And so did I in vain
But since it may not be
Let such fish there as find the gain
And leave the loss for me

“And with such luck and loss
I will content myself
Till tides of turning time may toss
Such fishers on the shelf

“And when they stick on sands
That every man may see
Then will I laugh and clap my hands
As they do now at me”"
Jen BryantAnd Later   "I take my kaleidoscope off the shelf
look through the little hole at the end
of the cardboard tube

I turn    and turn   and turn   and turn

letting the crystals shift into strange
and beautiful patterns letting the pieces fall
wherever they will"

found on our driveway
like a feather dropped
by a crow
 of spades
a playing
card /
we played Crazy Eights slapping
cards or holding them
as if they were birds that might fly
out of our hands

decades ago in our childhood
like the translucent whirling
image I imagine prismatic and phosphorescent —
a murmuration of starlings swooping
and iridescent

but it dissolved onto a gray wall undecorated

velvet Sunday best dresses yours
usually crimson mine blue
we never had nice shoes

Now you have returned to water

your ashes over the Pacific

Ceylon tea — that amber cup
from Sri Lanka popularly known here before
Americans became tea drinkers as
Orange Pekoe
our mother hated

so many things —
tea was
rattlesnake venom to
her
I embraced it  ///
What did you drink Marilyn I saw you only
with a Coke or a glass of wine in your hand
Our mother whom you felt
damaged you / your life    spirals the twisting iridescent birds
fly at me now            scintillating spinning
I blink

Our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day
Our sad mother
I blink

and tell it to go back to our childhood
of muddy little shoes from walking in
the spider-filled orange groves
There the damaging must have Begun  / she
loving me so much
more
than you

I wish there had been more stories
like the one about the origin of her disliking tea
at  she went to celebrate being made teacher
of the one-room school she had attended and
graduated from at her retiring teacher’s
home she was served for the first time — tea she
being from a German coffee-drinking family
Our mother
hated
it but politely choked it down
Would never again touch a drop of the
poisonous beverage
From that story we learned that
our mother ritualized
hating
something — expected us
to admire her for it
I took
that negative pattern
and spun it until I could have cloth enough
for an eloquent garment Perhaps the lesson simply made you
feel yourself      helpless     ragged           torn

I never
saw you that way Marilyn
though perhaps incomplete

I pour a cup of Assam Take a sip
let it wash through my mouth
down my age-damaged throat
think
of you sitting
with me in your Southern California
backyard one May morning
next to the camellia bush
I as always with a cup of tea in my hand
You smoking

I left all my family — you were part of it —
left California and reinvented myself even
mythologized myself as a tan “California Girl”
You did not become an artist or a poet

I suppose that’s why you felt damaged
If only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice
it took for me to get away
So many small things
can save us
from the damage
you talked of For me drinking that
first cup of Orange Pekoe
and making tea
my drink   risking rattlesnake poison
with every steaming cup
a tiny emblem of a rebellion I still try to practice

You left us so quickly Marilyn
and without any warning this January
your house full of cancelled aspirations — glass
bowls and cylinders and huge globes
filled with sea scallop shells
you combed the California seashores to
find collecting these empty shells washed
free of their biological life                 Out of the ocean

we two different daughters of a sailor

The spinning           the scissors        the measuring
and thus our lives are given out
from the heavens with unfair allotments
and varied unaccountable fates
born when we are and to whom

you would have prevailed
in an age where women had to spin
weave the material cut it into britches and dresses
undergarments and sheets sew
and keep clean warm and comfortable a
household full or a castle full / men
children hired hands maidservants — you would have

done it
so well

But you would have died young in such a world —
diabetes asthma chronic bronchial infections
even in the st century where you lived to be
    a world where all your skills were plied as
substitute
for being an artist

When I asked you a year ago
not knowing that you would die this January
what you would most like to have if
money were not the object
— since clearly all your measuring cutting and sewing
had been for economical reasons
not art —
you thought for a bit raising your chin

“A swimming pool in my backyard One I could
step into every morning swim float — maybe in the afternoon
I’d go for a dip Many evenings I think” she said
to me           Longing for some ocean

In our portrait
if someone paints it she will be
sitting in a scallop shell
her many jars of seashells behind her head I
will be invisible except for the spinning
murmuration of birds that radiates
past me

They read at her funeral a poem from her journal
about lying on the beach
the sand embracing her
How much she loved it / felt safe
felt released Oh Marilyn all
those seashells emptied of their living
fleshy occupants the ugly parts that die and rot now
glorious empty rooms
in which to live an imaginary life
to decorate
to create beauty
spaces to live
a different life

What is left but your desires locked in glass and
an image of you walking
your beloved beaches hands
full of seashells your
footprints measured then quickly filled
with the tidal flow

Easter Sunday You and I always dyed
Easter eggs together our mother busy at
her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job I
was intrigued with the colors
but they never turned out so bright when
coloring the eggs You the artist
were interested in the designs
to transfer onto the eggs
cartoons bunnies
chicks
We kept our eggs
separated from each other
put them in separate bowls neither
caring for the other’s creation Still we
felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects

Not enough to make us friends

My unwillingness to be like our classmates
embarrassed you You chose invisibility
in school rather than being known as “Diane’s
Sister”

That unwillingness to be like others
was what made me a poet So many little things but that earlydecision
of yours not to understand why I wanted to be weird
is what made you make so
many other small choices preventing you
from becoming an artist “Look away” our mother said to us
when there were ugly things confronting us
I could not do that You blame
our mother yet it was you who decided to look away
even though it meant not seeing the whole world
even if meant you didn’t become an artist
Poverty of course was the reason

we never had nice shoes

All numbers have
disappeared
instead
there are mushrooms
fungi that has always seemed
more artful than tasty

Sipping a cup of tea / soothes me

never could

with no horse I want only to watch
the stories unfold / the secret stories about why
you chose to marry and have children /
why

I did not / the stories

and the spider of eight
twirling on its silk line projecting infinity

to the unacceptable then dredge
yourself out

a crystalline body whirls
releasing me from
the history the stories it’s
so hard to tell
Until recent years my sister
and I either ignored or disliked each other
We fought continuously as children
I have in my wrist a black bump that
protrudes near a vein
It’s the point of a pencil
that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled
for the long yellow weapon
A pencil the weapon of a writer But there was
no bleeding no seeming-wound to be dressed
We never told
our Mother both too ashamed
of our brutality I’ve never asked a doctor
about it the pencil lead encapsulated
in my wrist Nor ever spoken
of it to anyone

I always wonder that so much must remain a secret

Why
we never had nice shoes

Drinking
a blend of traditional
Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon / this
tea takes me back to a Viennese visit drinking
this very tea in the afternoon while my friend Jonathan
ate their famous Sacher torte
The tea
seemed particularly aromatic —
“lightly scented with oil of bergamot
and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla”
Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear I didn’t know
the tea from the Sacher Hotel
was as famous as the cake
until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue
a listing for “Scented Darjeeling”
under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”
This tea
any cup of tea

Hard to believe
no
Sad to
think my Mother almost spat out her first taste
of tea

What worldly thing must I touch to
bring Marilyn back into my
sedate life my sister Marilyn who died in January

Her hand — I’d like to imagine timidly touching her
hand — Marilyn’s hand
Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring
In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette

Smoke and fire makes me think of her —
not water though it was that Pacific ocean
filled with seashells
that she was in touch with My old hands
not really like hers at all She had big hands for shaping things
while mine are small   like birds"
Andrew AllportAnd on the Third Day"We called off the search
and the weary climbed down from the glacier
with their dogs exhausted in the spring sun
too tired to eat the ice in their paws

We had called his name mostly for show
a ritual that kept us moving in the high bowls
their stunted pines predating the flood
in the steep ravines sliding loose with scree
loudly at first then speaking it to each other
then spelling it out on forms required by law

It is a form of praying he claimed to walk
out to the very edge of your life Every time
the reply comes clear as a stone
at our thin crowns It misses
almost every time humming as it goes"
Peter ColeAnd So the Skin   "And so their pounded hearts
were worn—
like a badge
or talisman
that canceled
almost all their blindness—

creations linkage depending
on a drive itself
derived from a kind of kindness
or desperation the sense that ones
inadequate
at any rate

the space for time—

water has it flowing
even from a faucet   
and here the black swan glides across it—

as the sunlights suddenly on my back
and now the skin along its warmer
Lord
which lets me walk by the river   "
Eavan BolandAnd Soul"My mother died one summer—
the wettest in the records of the state
Crops rotted in the west
Checked tablecloths dissolved in back gardens
Empty deck chairs collected rain
As I took my way to her
through traffic through lilacs dripping blackly
behind houses
and on curbsides to pay her
the last tribute of a daughter I thought of something
I remembered
I heard once that the body is or is
said to be almost all
water and as I turned southward that ours is
a city of it
one in which
every single day the elements begin
a journey towards each other that will never
given our weather
fail—
the ocean visible in the edges cut by it
cloud color reaching into air
the Liffey storing one and summoning the other
salt greeting the lack of it at the North Wall and
as if that wasnt enough all of it
ending up almost every evening
inside our speech—
coast canal ocean river stream and now
mother and I drove on and although
the mind is unreliable in grief at
the next cloudburst it almost seemed
they could be shades of each other
the way the body is
of every one of them and now
they were on the move again—fog into mist
mist into sea spray and both into the oily glaze
that lay on the railings of
the house she was dying in
as I went inside"
Carla Panciera"And Standing before Those Canvases He Said I Would Feel This Tingling""Some things no one says aloud
But he was there if he says he was

Bleaching fields and buttermilk
The stench of breweries and lye

Two-thirds of his life before this one Sky

His current city rises off a river not Lek
though here in the gallery a train ride away

The impossible familiar The somehow known

The curator has written
On the crowded ferry cows attempt to drink

But anyone can see that one scratches her neck
a good-sailor cow sickle-hocked not parched

Cows like that Yes He remembers

Also that downriver float the fishmongers’ baskets
of haddock and crab

On the way home this will be also his view
the river running toward its source a reverse birthing

But now he sees that Rembrandt has wired coils of light
into the shipbuilder’s ruff

He remembers shipbuilders the horizon
upon which sailed their fluyts and above which homesick

That was what we call a long time ago
because it has to be called something

And now The guard warns him back from one world

Rose hip Willow Sea salt    The infinite clouds"
Thomas LuxAnd Still It Comes"like a downhill brakes-burned freight train
full of pig iron ingots full of lead
life-size statues of Richard Nixon
like an avalanche of smoke and black fog
lashed by bent pins the broken-off tips
of switchblade knives the dust of dried offal
remorseless it comes faster when you turn your back
faster when you turn to face it
like a fine rain then colder showers
then downpour to razor sleet then egg-size hail
fist-size then jagged
laser shrapnel hail
thudding and tearing like footsteps
of drunk gods or fathers it comes
polite loutish assured suave
breathing through its mouth
which is a hole eaten by a cave
it comes like an elephant annoyed
like a black mamba terrified it slides
down the valley grease on grease
like fire eating birds’ nests
like fire melting the fuzz
off a baby’s skull still it comes mute
and gorging never
to cease insatiable gorging
and mute"
Mike PuicanAnd the Gauchos Sing"For Barry Silesky
Catalpas blooming up and down Catalpa Street car alarms blooming
up and down Waveland Avenue—an instant of nature without the narrative
O face-in-your-morning-juice swimmer-in-an-old-wool-suit
we sit side by side on the steps smoking the same cigarette
watching children who live alone women married to the wrong men

Here is your little dog roaming the alley What will he do for love this time
The gauchos sing “The silver lights of stars hurl themselves
against the open pampas of Clark Street” O tomato-in-a-woman’s-palm
one millisecond following the next millisecond “Heal thyself”
the poem says “Pick up your beggar’s mat and walk”

You hurl yourself into traffic You talk to cops and street thugs
they smile at their smartphonesThey strut in the sun like jackals
after a kill And the gauchos sing “Everyone will finally leave you fugitive”
A cloud of pigeons cuts through the smog Everyone will finally leave you

When the bus comes we sing like sailors A red sky presses you to its lips
I tell you that everything has already been written You say
on a long difficult pilgrimage Basho wrote on his hat"
Graham FoustAnd the Ghoststhey own everything
Trumbull Stickney"And the Last Day Being Come Man Stood Alone""And the last day being come Man stood alone
Ere sunrise on the world’s dismantled verge
Awaiting how from everywhere should urge
The Coming of the Lord And behold none

Did come—but indistinct from every realm
Of earth and air and water growing more
And louder shriller heavier a roar
Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm

His ears and as he looked affrighted round
Every manner of beast innumerable
All thro’ the shadows crying grew until
The wailing was like grass upon the ground

Asudden then within his human side
Their anguish since the goad he wielded first
And since he gave them not to drink their thirst
Darted compressed and vital—As he died

Low in the East now lighting gorgeously
He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed
Which with a spear transfixèd yet availed
To pluck the sun down into the dead sea"
Joel BrouwerAnd the Ship Sails On"He faced the sink one foot up
on the edge of the tub She stood
behind him reaching around
In the mirror her face rose
over his shoulder like the moon
and like the moon she regarded him
beautifully but without feeling
and he looked at her as he would
at the moonHow beautiful
How distant No smiling no weeping
no talking A man and a woman
transacting their magnificent business
with the usual equanimity The man
as a passenger walking the ship’s deck
at evening and the woman as the moon
over his shoulder oiling the ocean
with light Deep in the ship’s belly
pistons churned and sailors fed
the boilers roar with coal On deck
just the engine’s dull thrum and
a faint click as the woman sets her ring
on the cool white lip of the sink"
George Oppen‘And Their Winter and Night in Disguise’"The sea and a crescent strip of beach
Show between the service station and a deserted shack

A creek drains thru the beach
Forming a ditch
There is a discarded super-market cart in the ditch
That beach is the edge of a nation

There is something like shouting along the highway
A California shouting
On the long fast highway over the California mountains

Point Pedro
Its distant life

It is impossible the world should be either good or bad
If its colors are beautiful or if they are not beautiful
If parts of it taste good or if no parts of it taste good
It is as remarkable in one case as the other
As against this

We have suffered fear we know something of fear
And of humiliation mounting to horror

The world above the edge of the foxhole belongs to the flying bullets leaden superbeings
For the men grovelling in the foxhole danger danger in being drawn to them

These little dumps
The poem is about them

Our hearts are twisted
In dead men’s pride

Dead men crowd us
Lean over us

In the emplacements

The skull spins
Empty of subject

The hollow ego

Flinching from the war’s huge air

Tho we are delivery boys and bartenders

We will choke on each other

Minds may crack

But not for what is discovered

Unless that everyone knew
And kept silent

Our minds are split
To seek the danger out

From among the miserable soldiers"
Alfred CornAnd Then I Saw"My body laid out on a marble slab
Naked but for a linen sheet tucked under
Its chin as though to keep the patient warm

A solemn band approached identified
The late departed with what looked like mingled
Relief mild satisfaction and bereavement

One of them took away an arm—the right
Was it—and loped off with a spring in his step
Which prompted others to do likewise here

A shoulder suitable for crying on
there a foot there an eye and there an ear
Plump already one scooped out the belly

Just who you’d imagine claimed the head
Not the one I hoped tugged loose a rib
Some by no means all I knew as friends

But felt no bitterness instead acceptance
This while watching their several withdrawals
Travelers moving farther out and deeper

Into the ringing distance—who all began
To flourish somehow more intently themselves
Than they had earlier resolved to be

Was glad of that despite a fit of shivers
Simple human nature still presiding
When I took note of the rummage that remained

Wishing a greener plot had been marked out
For what had breathed with so much spark and promise
My turn then to come forward for a closer

Look and since no one else had carried off
That steady flexibly strung pump at rest
Beneath the sternum take it for my own

Sensing its mute but anchored trust that parts
Lucky for others would befriend as well—
Oh love
—even the heir that flesh once named"
Wendy XuAnd Then It Was Less Bleak Because We Said So"Today there has been so much talk of things exploding
into other things so much that we all become curious that we
all run outside into the hot streets
and hug Romance is a grotto of eager stones
anticipating light or a girl whose teeth
you can always see With more sparkle and pop
is the only way to live Your confetti tongue explodes
into acid jazz Small typewriters
that other people keep in their eyes
click away at all our farewell parties It is hard
to pack for the rest of your life Someone is always
eating cold cucumber noodles Someone will drop by later
to help dismantle some furniture A lot can go wrong
if you sleep or think but the trees go on waving
their broken little hands"
Stephen Connolly“And then the sun”"im
And then the sun came slicing sideways
clear water reflecting it giving it slant
A gloss of rain so quick and light that day

hardly made a sound The thought of sheets
hung out and drying on the line of seeds
in soil and soil itself the glutting ends

of stems of leaves that will them to let fall
up and out and through the trees the shape
that shoots could take of you

and this moment as it happens
our echoing hush as we try to hold
the close music of the blackbird in the bush


•


And then the sun continued on
Lough Neagh cooled under the firm keels
of fishing boats on the water’s taut skin

their painted hulls in pointed arcs
an emblem of balance so finely wrought
that they could tell the weight of light or air

Each night we walk along the shore
expecting still to find your sturdy figure
waist-deep in waders plumbing darkness

hauling it in but never again your grip
on the reel and never again the deft music
of the blackbird nesting in your hand"
Cesare Pavese“And then we cowards”"And then we cowards
who loved the whispering
evening the houses
the paths by the river
the dirty red lights
of those places the sweet
soundless sorrow—
we reached our hands out
toward the living chain
in silence but our heart
startled us with blood
and no more sweetness then
no more losing ourselves
on the path by the river—
no longer slaves we knew
we were alone and alive"
Thomas HardyAnd There Was a Great Calm"On the Signing of the Armistice  Nov 

I
There had been years of Passion—scorching cold
And much Despair and Anger heaving high
Care whitely watching Sorrows manifold
Among the young among the weak and old
And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered “Why”


II
Men had not paused to answer Foes distraught
Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness
Philosophies that sages long had taught
And Selflessness were as an unknown thought
And “Hell” and “Shell” were yapped at Lovingkindness


III
The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
To dug-outs snipers Huns from the war-adept
In the mornings heard and at evetides perused
To day-dreamt men in millions when they mused—
To nightmare-men in millions when they slept


IV
Waking to wish existence timeless null
Sirius they watched above where armies fell
He seemed to check his flapping when in the lull
Of night a boom came thencewise like the dull
Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well


V
So when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
Were dead and damned there sounded War is done
One morrow Said the bereft and meek and lowly
Will men some day be given to grace yea wholly
And in good sooth as our dreams used to run


VI
Breathless they paused Out there men raised their glance
To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped
As they had raised it through the four years’ dance
Of Death in the now familiar flats of France
And murmured Strange this How All firing stopped


VII
Aye all was hushed The about-to-fire fired not
The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song
One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
And turned The Spirit of Irony smirked out What
Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong


VIII
Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray
No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn
No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray
Worn horses mused We are not whipped to-day
No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn


IX
Calm fell From Heaven distilled a clemency
There was peace on earth and silence in the sky
Some could some could not shake off misery
The Sinister Spirit sneered It had to be
And again the Spirit of Pity whispered Why"
Lord ron George Gordon"And Thou art Dead as Young and Fair""And thou art dead as young and fair
As aught of mortal birth
And form so soft and charms so rare
Too soon returnd to Earth
Though Earth receivd them in her bed
And oer the spot the crowd may tread
In carelessness or mirth
There is an eye which could not brook
A moment on that grave to look

I will not ask where thou liest low
Nor gaze upon the spot
There flowers or weeds at will may grow
So I behold them not
It is enough for me to prove
That what I lovd and long must love
Like common earth can rot
To me there needs no stone to tell
T is Nothing that I lovd so well

Yet did I love thee to the last
As fervently as thou
Who didst not change through all the past
And canst not alter now
The love where Death has set his seal
Nor age can chill nor rival steal
Nor falsehood disavow
And what were worse thou canst not see
Or wrong or change or fault in me

The better days of life were ours
The worst can be but mine
The sun that cheers the storm that lowers
Shall never more be thine
The silence of that dreamless sleep
I envy now too much to weep
Nor need I to repine
That all those charms have passd away
I might have watchd through long decay

The flower in ripend bloom unmatchd
Must fall the earliest prey
Though by no hand untimely snatchd
The leaves must drop away
And yet it were a greater grief
To watch it withering leaf by leaf
Than see it pluckd to-day
Since earthly eye but ill can bear
To trace the change to foul from fair

I know not if I could have borne
To see thy beauties fade
The night that followd such a morn
Had worn a deeper shade
Thy day without a cloud hath passd
And thou wert lovely to the last
Extinguishd not decayd
As stars that shoot along the sky
Shine brightest as they fall from high

As once I wept if I could weep
My tears might well be shed
To think I was not near to keep
One vigil oer thy bed
To gaze how fondly on thy face
To fold thee in a faint embrace
Uphold thy drooping head
And show that love however vain
Nor thou nor I can feel again

Yet how much less it were to gain
Though thou hast left me free
The loveliest things that still remain
Than thus remember thee
The all of thine that cannot die
Through dark and dread Eternity
Returns again to me
And more thy buried love endears
Than aught except its living years"
John Ashbery"And
  
   Ut Pictura Poesis
  
  Is Her Name""You can’t say it that way any more
Bothered about beauty you have to
Come out into the open into a clearing
And rest Certainly whatever funny happens to you
Is OK To demand more than this would be strange
Of you you who have so many lovers
People who look up to you and are willing
To do things for you but you think
It’s not right that if they really knew you   
So much for self-analysis Now
About what to put in your poem-painting
Flowers are always nice particularly delphinium
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds
Skyrockets are good—do they still exist
There are a lot of other things of the same quality
As those I’ve mentioned Now one must
Find a few important words and a lot of low-keyed
Dull-sounding ones She approached me
About buying her desk Suddenly the street was
Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments
Humdrum testaments were scattered around His head
Locked into mine We were a seesaw Something
Ought to be written about how this affects
You when you write poetry
The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind
Colliding with the lush Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate
Something between breaths if only for the sake
Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you
For other centers of communication so that understanding
May begin and in doing so be undone"
Rebecca WolffAnd when I say poem"I mean this thing

I want to write and no other

You will not be so clever

as to resurrect the feathered

the tatty wings of a costumed

angel in my dining room

tatty spatial realm

room where I exist and look at things and eat them

and float nine inches above the floor

and no one else need know

and no other poet

will do



The poet will do

what the poet will do and mime

or maim the poet

meme—in fancy

venue or classroom or focus

group the wings of the poet

relax and warm and shed and oracular

shit out the window in a pile by the side of the road

and the commitment of the poet

to engage subvert refract or remand

is safe in my vagina at last where it belongs"
Kahlil GibranAnd When My Sorrow was Born"And when my Joy was born I held it in my arms and stood on the
house-top shouting “Come ye my neighbours come and see for Joy
this day is born unto me Come and behold this gladsome thing that
laugheth in the sun”

But none of my neighbours came to look upon my Joy and great was
my astonishment

And every day for seven moons I proclaimed my Joy from the
house-top—and yet no one heeded me And my Joy and I were alone
unsought and unvisited

Then my Joy grew pale and weary because no other heart but mine
held its loveliness and no other lips kissed its lips

Then my Joy died of isolation

And now I only remember my dead Joy in remembering my dead Sorrow
But memory is an autumn leaf that murmurs a while in the wind and
then is heard no more"
Sir  Thomas WyattAnd Wilt thou Leave me Thus"And wilt thou leave me thus
Say nay say nay for shame
To save thee from the blame
Of all my grief and grame
And wilt thou leave me thus
Say nay say nay

And wilt thou leave me thus
That hath loved thee so long
In wealth and woe among
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus
Say nay say nay

And wilt thou leave me thus
That hath given thee my heart
Never for to depart
Nother for pain nor smart
And wilt thou leave me thus
Say nay say nay

And wilt thou leave me thus
And have no more pity
Of him that loveth thee
Hélas thy cruelty
And wilt thou leave me thus
Say nay say nay"

and presses it from their needles outside the Dye House

I am blinking in the atrium the library
I don’t know if you have a room for me

Robert BrowningAndrea del Sarto"But do not let us quarrel any more
No my Lucrezia bear with me for once
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish
You turn your face but does it bring your heart
Ill work then for your friends friend never fear
Treat his own subject after his own way
Fix his own time accept too his own price
And shut the money into this small hand
When next it takes mine Will it tenderly
Oh Ill content him—but to-morrow Love
I often am much wearier than you think
This evening more than usual and it seems
As if—forgive now—should you let me sit
Here by the window with your hand in mine
And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole
Both of one mind as married people use
Quietly quietly the evening through
I might get up to-morrow to my work
Cheerful and fresh as ever Let us try
To-morrow how you shall be glad for this
Your soft hand is a woman of itself
And mine the mans bared breast she curls inside
Dont count the time lost neither you must serve
For each of the five pictures we require
It saves a model So keep looking so—
My serpentining beauty rounds on rounds
—How could you ever prick those perfect ears
Even to put the pearl there oh so sweet—
My face my moon my everybodys moon
Which everybody looks on and calls his
And I suppose is looked on by in turn
While she looks—no ones very dear no less
You smile why theres my picture ready made
Theres what we painters call our harmony
A common greyness silvers everything—
All in a twilight you and I alike
—You at the point of your first pride in me
Thats gone you know—but I at every point
My youth my hope my art being all toned down
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole
Theres the bell clinking from the chapel-top
That length of convent-wall across the way
Holds the trees safer huddled more inside
The last monk leaves the garden days decrease
And autumn grows autumn in everything
Eh the whole seems to fall into a shape
As if I saw alike my work and self
And all that I was born to be and do
A twilight-piece Love we are in Gods hand
How strange now looks the life he makes us lead
So free we seem so fettered fast we are
I feel he laid the fetter let it lie
This chamber for example—turn your head—
All thats behind us You dont understand
Nor care to understand about my art
But you can hear at least when people speak
And that cartoon the second from the door
—It is the thing Love so such things should be—
Behold Madonna—I am bold to say
I can do with my pencil what I know
What I see what at bottom of my heart
I wish for if I ever wish so deep—
Do easily too—when I say perfectly
I do not boast perhaps yourself are judge
Who listened to the Legates talk last week
And just as much they used to say in France
At any rate tis easy all of it
No sketches first no studies thats long past
I do what many dream of all their lives
—Dream strive to do and agonize to do
And fail in doing I could count twenty such
On twice your fingers and not leave this town
Who strive—you dont know how the others strive
To paint a little thing like that you smeared
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat—
Yet do much less so much less Someone says
I know his name no matter—so much less
Well less is more Lucrezia I am judged
There burns a truer light of God in them
In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain
Heart or whateer else than goes on to prompt
This low-pulsed forthright craftsmans hand of mine
Their works drop groundward but themselves I know
Reach many a time a heaven thats shut to me
Enter and take their place there sure enough
Though they come back and cannot tell the world
My works are nearer heaven but I sit here
The sudden blood of these men at a word—
Praise them it boils or blame them it boils too
I painting from myself and to myself
Know what I do am unmoved by mens blame
Or their praise either Somebody remarks
Morellos outline there is wrongly traced
His hue mistaken what of that or else
Rightly traced and well ordered what of that
Speak as they please what does the mountain care
Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp
Or whats a heaven for All is silver-grey
Placid and perfect with my art the worse
I know both what I want and what might gain
And yet how profitless to know to sigh
""Had I been two another and myself
""Our head would have oerlooked the world"" No doubt
Yonders a work now of that famous youth
The Urbinate who died five years ago
Tis copied George Vasari sent it me
Well I can fancy how he did it all
Pouring his soul with kings and popes to see
Reaching that heaven might so replenish him
Above and through his art—for it gives way
That arm is wrongly put—and there again—
A fault to pardon in the drawings lines
Its body so to speak its soul is right
He means right—that a child may understand
Still what an arm and I could alter it
But all the play the insight and the stretch—
Out of me out of me And wherefore out
Had you enjoined them on me given me soul
We might have risen to Rafael I and you
Nay Love you did give all I asked I think—
More than I merit yes by many times
But had you—oh with the same perfect brow
And perfect eyes and more than perfect mouth
And the low voice my soul hears as a bird
The fowlers pipe and follows to the snare —
Had you with these the same but brought a mind
Some women do so Had the mouth there urged
""God and the glory never care for gain
""The present by the future what is that
""Live for fame side by side with Agnolo
""Rafael is waiting up to God all three""
I might have done it for you So it seems
Perhaps not All is as God over-rules
Beside incentives come from the souls self
The rest avail not Why do I need you
What wife had Rafael or has Agnolo
In this world who can do a thing will not
And who would do it cannot I perceive
Yet the wills somewhat—somewhat too the power—
And thus we half-men struggle At the end
God I conclude compensates punishes
Tis safer for me if the award be strict
That I am something underrated here
Poor this long while despised to speak the truth
I dared not do you know leave home all day
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords
The best is when they pass and look aside
But they speak sometimes I must bear it all
Well may they speak That Francis that first time
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground
Put on the glory Rafaels daily wear
In that humane great monarchs golden look—
One finger in his beard or twisted curl
Over his mouths good mark that made the smile
One arm about my shoulder round my neck
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear
I painting proudly with his breath on me
All his court round him seeing with his eyes
Such frank French eyes and such a fire of souls
Profuse my hand kept plying by those hearts—
And best of all this this this face beyond
This in the background waiting on my work
To crown the issue with a last reward
A good time was it not my kingly days
And had you not grown restless but I know—
Tis done and past twas right my instinct said
Too live the life grew golden and not grey
And Im the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world
How could it end in any other way
You called me and I came home to your heart
The triumph was—to reach and stay there since
I reached it ere the triumph what is lost
Let my hands frame your face in your hairs gold
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine
""Rafael did this Andrea painted that
""The Romans is the better when you pray
""But still the others Virgin was his wife—""
Men will excuse me I am glad to judge
Both pictures in your presence clearer grows
My better fortune I resolve to think
For do you know Lucrezia as God lives
Said one day Agnolo his very self
To Rafael    I have known it all these years   
When the young man was flaming out his thoughts
Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see
Too lifted up in heart because of it
""Friend theres a certain sorry little scrub
""Goes up and down our Florence none cares how
""Who were he set to plan and execute
""As you are pricked on by your popes and kings
""Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours""
To Rafaels—And indeed the arm is wrong
I hardly dare    yet only you to see
Give the chalk here—quick thus the line should go
Ay but the soul hes Rafael rub it out
Still all I care for if he spoke the truth
What he why who but Michel Agnolo
Do you forget already words like those
If really there was such a chance so lost—
Is whether youre—not grateful—but more pleased
Well let me think so And you smile indeed
This hour has been an hour Another smile
If you would sit thus by me every night
I should work better do you comprehend
I mean that I should earn more give you more
See it is settled dusk now theres a star
Morellos gone the watch-lights show the wall
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by
Come from the window love—come in at last
Inside the melancholy little house
We built to be so gay with God is just
King Francis may forgive me oft at nights
When I look up from painting eyes tired out
The walls become illumined brick from brick
Distinct instead of mortar fierce bright gold
That gold of his I did cement them with
Let us but love each other Must you go
That Cousin here again he waits outside
Must see you—you and not with me Those loans
More gaming debts to pay you smiled for that
Well let smiles buy me have you more to spend
While hand and eye and something of a heart
Are left me works my ware and whats it worth
Ill pay my fancy Only let me sit
The grey remainder of the evening out
Idle you call it and muse perfectly
How I could paint were I but back in France
One picture just one more—the Virgins face
Not yours this time I want you at my side
To hear them—that is Michel Agnolo—
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth
Will you To-morrow satisfy your friend
I take the subjects for his corridor
Finish the portrait out of hand—there there
And throw him in another thing or two
If he demurs the whole should prove enough
To pay for this same Cousins freak Beside
Whats better and whats all I care about
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff
Love does that please you Ah but what does he
The Cousin what does he to please you more

I am grown peaceful as old age to-night
I regret little I would change still less
Since there my past life lies why alter it
The very wrong to Francis—it is true
I took his coin was tempted and complied
And built this house and sinned and all is said
My father and my mother died of want
Well had I riches of my own you see
How one gets rich Let each one bear his lot
They were born poor lived poor and poor they died
And I have laboured somewhat in my time
And not been paid profusely Some good son
Paint my two hundred pictures—let him try
No doubt theres something strikes a balance Yes
You loved me quite enough it seems to-night
This must suffice me here What would one have
In heaven perhaps new chances one more chance—
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem
Meted on each side by the angels reed
For Leonard Rafael Agnolo and me
To cover—the three first without a wife
While I have mine So—still they overcome
Because theres still Lucrezia—as I choose

Again the Cousins whistle Go my Love"
Tennessee Williams"Androgyne Mon Amour""I

Androgyne mon amour
brochette de coeur was plat du jour
heart lifted on a metal skewer
encore saignante et palpitante
where I dined au solitaire
table intime one rose vase
lighted dimly wildly gay
as punctually across the bay
mist advanced its pompe funèbre
its coolly silvered drift of gray
nightly requiem performed for
mourners who have slipped away

Well thats it the evening scene
mon amour Androgyne

Noontime youths
thighs and groins tight-jean-displayed
loiter onto Union Square
junkies flower-scattered there
lost in dream torso-bare
young as you old as I voicing soundlessly
a cry
oh yes among them
revolution bites its tongue beneath its fiery
waiting stare
indifferent to sirens wail
ravishment endured in jail
Bicentennial salute
Youth made flesh of crouching brute

Dichotomy can I deny of pity in a lustful eye

II

Androgyne mon amour
shadows of you name a price
exorbitant for short lease
What would you suggest I do
wryly smile and turn away
fox-teeth gnawing chest-bones through

Even less would that be true
than carnally I was to you
many many lives ago
requiems of fallen snow

And frankly well theyd laugh at me
thick of belly thin of shank
spectacle of long neglect
tragedian of public mirth

Chekhovs Mashas all wore black
for a reason I suspect
Pertinence None at all—
yet something made me think of that

""Life"" the gob exclaimed to Crane
""Oh lifes a geyser""
Oui daccord—
from the rectum of the earth

Bitter that Never mind
Times only challenger is time

III

Androgyne mon amour
cold withdrawal is no cure
for addiction grown so deep
Now finally at cocks crow
released in custody of sleep
dark annealment time-worn stones
far descending
no light there no sound there
entering depths of thinning breath
farther down more ancient stones
halting not drawn on until

Ever treacherous ever fair
at a table small and square
not first light but last light shows
meaning of the single rose
where I dined au solitaire
sous lombre dune jeunesse perdue

A ghostly little customs-clerk
""Vos documents Mesdames Messieurs""
whose somehow tender mockery
contrives to make admittance here
at this mineral frontier
a definition of the pure

Wallace StevensAnecdote of the Jar"I placed a jar in Tennessee
And round it was upon a hill
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill

The wilderness rose up to it
And sprawled around no longer wild
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air

It took dominion everywhere
The jar was gray and bare
It did not give of bird or bush
Like nothing else in Tennessee"

Angela JacksonAngel"for Jerry Ward
I am the only one here

I stand in my one place
and I can see a good piece
down the road I am yonder
further than the chunk of your stone
Right now directly
I am persimmon falling free
and the prisoner opening up
in me
Don’t come through my door and
want to run my house I am
the angel who sweep air in and out my own
dancing body I got good eyes I can see
A good piece down the road Clear to
God murmuring in me My head is the burning
bush What I hold in my hand is the promised
land I set my people free in me
And we walk without wandering like people named
after mere plants
because we are tree
and high-stepping roots
cake-walking
in this promised place

Where I go is where I am now
Don’t mess with me you hurt yourself
In the middle of my stride now I am walking
yes indeed I am walking through my own house
I am walking yes indeed on my own piece of road
Toting my own load
and yours and mine
I tell you
I feel fine and clear this morning even
when it’s night and a full moon with my thumbprint
on it
Everything is clamorous and quiet
I am the only One here
And we don’t break No indeed
Come hell and high water
We don’t break
for nothing"

Dana GioiaThe Angel with the Broken Wing"I am the Angel with the Broken Wing
The one large statue in this quiet room
The staff finds me too fierce and so they shut
Faith’s ardor in this air-conditioned tomb

The docents praise my elegant design
Above the chatter of the gallery
Perhaps I am a masterpiece of sorts—
The perfect emblem of futility

Mendoza carved me for a country church
His name’s forgotten now except by me
I stood beside a gilded altar where
The hopeless offered God their misery

I heard their women whispering at my feet—
Prayers for the lost the dying and the dead
Their candles stretched my shadow up the wall
And I became the hunger that they fed

I broke my left wing in the Revolution
Even a saint can savor irony
When troops were sent to vandalize the chapel
They hit me once—almost apologetically

For even the godless feel something in a church
A twinge of hope fear Who knows what it is
A trembling unaccounted by their laws
An ancient memory they can’t dismiss

There are so many things I must tell God
The howling of the dammed can’t reach so high
But I stand like a dead thing nailed to a perch
A crippled saint against a painted sky"

The pulchritude
of bombazine

geoidal mid-afternoon
dribbling from
sea rock to splint
the wing tips

accoutrements
their own swinging
by the bay of a chest

pelagic with clot

burble with oratory

Angela JacksonAngelhair"In the redcoat she who is I was
an angel dark and bright

Mama chose the drama
pretty scarlet to subdue the white
walk a world dumb with snow

patentleather shoes to shine
the path over ice My

father paid the way
His teeth salt inside the grin

I who’s she had a manner
of leaping toward a light
suddenly running into ecstasy
or heat exquisitely blind
in the body racing inside it-
self A little fit of imagining

Thin arms cropped wings
to hold the bristly branches of fir and sing-
ing sisters and brothers itching
happy from angelhair fine as a strand of cat
hair split six ways and brushed into the skin
to itch and itch again
We were wild and giddy with gifts

It was then and always as all souls itch and spin
in lit-red coats that float down this narrow vein
so we spin in O to someone who loves us
and suffers the world for each turn before a mirror
quiet as ice we fall all through at last
here in memory’s tiny Paradise"
Aphra BehnAngellica’s Lament"Had I remained in innocent security
I should have thought all men were born my slaves
And worn my power like lightning in my eyes
To have destroyed at pleasure when offended
—But when love held the mirror the undeceiving glass
Reflected all the weakness of my soul and made me know
My richest treasure being lost my honour
All the remaining spoil could not be worth
The conqueror’s care or value
—Oh how I fell like a long worshipped idol
Discovering all the cheat"

No government cares what you do with them

Sometimes they have been said to inspire a man to do more with his life than he might have
But what is there for a man to do with his life

   They burn beautifully with a blue flame

When they cry out it is like the screech of a tiny hinge the cry of a bat No one hears it   "
Gjertrud SchnackenbergAngels Grieving over the Dead Christ"The epitaphios of Thessaloniki
From those few famous silkworms smuggled
Into Constantinople in the head of a walking stick
Silk waterfalls
Poured from the ancient bolts

Into now-destitute reservoirs
Of church treasuries in Aachen
In Liège in Maastricht in Sens
In the Sancta Sanctorum of the Vatican

Bright rivers seeping past
The age when a teaspoonful of
Silkworm eggs the size of one grain
Could endow a church

The age when the letters in the words
Of sacred testaments were
Unreeled in the coastal cities of Asia Minor
When a bookworm conspired

To wrest a maze of empty roads
Through the words My Lord—
That ancient flickering text
Once permanently affixed

By blind but face-picturing speechless
But law-breaking wooden shuttles
Now a heap of gold wires displayed
With a crumbling silk vestment someone

Plucked from a shovelful of dust
During one of those treasure hunts conducted
In the burying grounds in other eras
A shovelful of dust

Now blowing into your eyes
As if a storm wind from Paradise
Blew the rumors of this death
So hard you must cover your eyes

Before the museum case
The late afternoon tugs
At a gold thread you can hear fraying
When you close your eyes

A thread you feel your way along
A thread at which the invisible globe pulls
Leading you to the end of the world
Where there is a pile of

Clothes stolen from the grave
Where your fear is relegated
To a masterwork of silk slaves—
That He is dead

Here death is only a flash of worlds
Unfurled from a rifled
Church treasury and you are invited
To walk this alluvial wave of gold

To walk in the labyrinths
Of the angels’ howls
To run your hands along the walls
Of the silk thread’s passageways

To feel with your fingers
The angels’ barbaric stifled
Glittering vowels
Tightly woven with gold wires

If you were to tug at one
Unraveling the angels
Into a vivid labyrinth of thread
From the fourteenth century

Backwards to the scissors blade
A seraph takes to a fragile
Filament of gilt
According to a law still unrevealed

The shroud would disappear
In the gust of a little breeze
From this door left ajar
Into the next life

The threshold we cross with closed eyes—
Where angels hide behind their backs
The saws with which they mean
To saw the present from the past

Oblivious to the scarlet threads
That prove to be hidden among
The filaments those red rivers
Running through the theme of time

So shockingly—so before you set foot there
Take heed This is the work
Of Byzantine silk slaves confined
To the palace grounds at Constantinople

And you must beware
There was a way station
On the Silk Road
Where the authorities executed

Traitors in a wooden box
In innumerable unspeakable ways
When you touch this shroud from the east
You take that hundred feet of road

You must walk softly past
You must try not to look
The torrent of words—later later
Here tongues are cut out

And that is why the howling
Is mute
Gilded herringboned
Because although this is death

It is the work of slaves
Whose task was only
To expose the maximum amount of gold thread
To the ceiling price of so many nomismata

Per square inch in a swift mischief
Of curious knots of mazes
Flashing past of straight paths
Made inextricable

So look again
The angels wring their hands
Over a statue They are deranged
But not by grief They mourn

Not a body but a work in bronze
They do not bring a mortal to the grave
But we onlookers who grieve and grieve—
We cannot relegate this thought

To a glory woven cryptically
In heavy silks
We cannot consign it sweep it off
For we cannot weigh

In our palms the empty cocoons
We cannot study
Within the secret workshops
Of the silkworm

We cannot touch the boiling
Water where the spools whirl
We cannot learn firsthand
The bleakness of the craft

With which God made the world
We cannot recount the legend that
When they met face-to-face both
God and the worm laughed"

When in a farmhouse kitchen that smelled
of old rinds and wet cigarette butts
I hoisted the shotgun to my shoulder
and aimed but did not fire it at the man
who had just taken my virginity like a snack
with my collusion but still —

When I sat in a conference room
in an inquisition
at the “newspaper of record”
across from the one slurping his pipe
the one arching her eyebrow
and I felt the heat like a wet brand in my chest
repaid insult for insult and left their fancy job
like a squashed bug on the floor —

When I was twelve too old the last time my father
spanked me pants down
because I had “distressed” my mother
and my vision went red-black and
I did not forgive —

When during my travels along the Gulf Coast
the intruder returned in the night
and I did not call the cops again but stood
with a butcher knife facing the door yelling “Come in”
although this time it was just the wind flapping
and banging the screen door —

When across a skating-rink-sized glistening table
I told the committee chair and her brooch I was a fan of Marx
and lost the fellowship —

When I threw a pot of hot coffee
and it just missed a man’s head and the black-brown spatter stains
were still there four years later long after he’d left me
when I finally moved out of that East Village hole —

I would have had to be thinking
in order to have thought — loaded not loaded
— and I was not thinking I was only dripping hot
and oh the pleasure I can still feel its prickling
crackle over the furnace of my rage
to see his face go pale his eyes widen
his “put it down put it down” — and I
put it down and allowed my life as well as his
to go on

I miss my anger Decades go by
when all I can muster is absent-minded invective
you know directed at the news
or a brief fantasy
of shoving someone in front of a bus Yesterday
I slammed my fist on my desk
and then apologized to the desk

Consider the tapestry of the seven deadly sins at Saint-Denis
Anger wild-haired and half-dressed
picked out in blue and silver thread bunched
against the crimson
rough against the fingertips she
rides a black boar dappled with blood
and waves her double-headed axe —

Yes I remember her
I always lie when I always say
I didn’t know the gun was loaded"
Brenda HillmanAngrily Standing Outside in the Wind"—kept losing self control
but how could one lose the self
after reading so much literary theory
The shorter ""i"" stood under the cork trees
the taller ""I"" remained rather passive
the brendas were angry at the greed angry
that the trees would die had lost interest
in the posturing of the privileged

the gaps between cant amp wont
Stood outside the gate of permissible
sound amp the wind came soughing
through the doubt debris
soughing comes from swāgh— to resound
echo actually comes from this also—
we thought of old Hegel across
the sea—the Weltgeist—amp clouds

went by like the bones of a Kleenex
its too late for countries
but its not too late for trees

Chase TwichellAnimal Graves"The mower flipped it belly up
a baby garter less than a foot long
dull green with a single sharp

stripe of pale manila down its back
same color as the underside
which was cut in two places

a loop of intestine poking out

It wouldnt live
so I ran the blades over it again

and cut it again but didn’t kill it

and again and then again
a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke
on me like a swarm of bees

It took so long
my mind had time to spiral
back to the graveyard

I tended as a child
for the dead ones wild and tame
fish from the bubbling green aquarium

squirrels from the road
the bluejay stalked to a raucous death
by Cicero the patient the tireless hunter

who himself was laid to rest
one August afternoon
under a rock painted gray his color

with a white splash for his white splash

Once in the woods I found the skeleton
of a deer laid out like a diagram

long spine curved like a necklace of crude ochre spools
with the string rotted away

and the dull metal shaft of the arrow
lying where it must have pierced

not the heart not the head
but the underbelly the soft part
where the sex once was

I carried home the skull
with its nubs of not-yet-horns
which the mice had overlooked

and set it on a rock
in my kingdom of the dead

Before I chopped the little snake
to bits of raw mosaic

it drew itself
into an upward-straining coil
head weaving mouth open

hissing at the noise that hurt it

The stripe was made
of tiny paper diamonds
sharp-edged but insubstantial

like an x-ray of the spine
or the ghost beginning to pull away

What taught the snake to make itself
seem bigger than it was
to spend those last few seconds

dancing in the roar
and shadow of its death

Now I see though none exists
its grave

harebells withered in a jar
a yellow spiral
painted on a green-black stone

a ring of upright pine cones for a fence
That’s how the deer skull lay in state

until one of the neighborhood dogs
came to claim it

and carried it off to bury
in the larger graveyard of the world"
Zachary SchomburgThe Animal Spell"Someone once told me that animals are people under spells and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted I recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan I watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours watched her peck bugs from her breast I was sure she would make a beautiful bride but she was always a black trumpeter swan I once brushed a horse’s hair for  straight years until it crumpled into death The truth is there is no such thing as spells The world is always as it is and always as it seems And love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood"
Rachel FieldThe Animal Store"If I had a hundred dollars to spend
Or maybe a little more
I’d hurry as fast as my legs would go
Straight to the animal store

I wouldn’t say “How much for this or that”
“What kind of a dog is he”
I’d buy as many as rolled an eye
Or wagged a tail at me

I’d take the hound with the drooping ears
That sits by himself alone
Cockers and Cairns and wobbly pups
For to be my very own

I might buy a parrot all red and green
And the monkey I saw before
If I had a hundred dollars to spend
Or maybe a little more"
Carol V DavisAnimal Time"I do better in animal time
a creeping dawn slow ticking toward dusk
In the middle of the day on the Nebraska prairie
I’m unnerved by subdued sounds as if listening
through water even the high-pitched drone of the
cicadas faint the blackbirds half-heartedly singing
As newlyweds my parents drove cross country to
Death Valley last leg of their escape from New York
the thick soups of their immigrant mothers generations
of superstitions that squeezed them from all sides
They camped under stars that meant no harm
It was the silence that alerted them to danger
They climbed back into their tiny new car locked
its doors and blinked their eyes until daylight"

As creatures coming out to play
in the twilight of creation
human faces intelligent and suffering
turned upward entering the trees
The charismatic megafauna
polar bears moose rippling massive flanks
to shake loose biting flies
The fox and the vixen The leopard
dazzling in his camouflage breaking
the urgent glass In the underlayer
of  humus and moss and broken clay
the cryptogams the earthworms turning
between the wizardly fingers
of the forest managed growth
of the second order the third steered
toward what shoal a history
for the benefit of imaginary extrinsic persons
In the branches snowy owls
and ravens or the rock pigeons we call
pigeons that can’t perch in trees that swarm cities
like the flying rats they are hungry
iridescent at the neck like the
rats themselves shining like a collar
at the base of a public sculpture
monument to the fundamental flight
through corridors of power mathematics

down State Street paralleling Michigan
pushed by the restless concinnations

desert of water
meeting the migrations of alien carp and
cosmic rays diving deep for the wreck

as in an etching by Blake horizontal

inhuman round eyes fixed on nothing on suffering
folly sporting events on Gaza —
wings outstretched to bandage the eyes of  Heaven
our eyes
as they would bandage the wound of a headless child
or conceal the strength of a people
from their weakness the mortals
masquerading as their own fates individuals
slashed open by solitude acts of mourning
and revenge writing themselves
into the text of righteousness The messengers
reveal nothing like the animals
marching slowly toward me now two by two
tongues lolling eyes lit from within hollow and sparkling
as a cave concealed from light for thirty thousand years
but concealed no longer Grace have I none
but what can be inferred
by arms opening palms head tilting back
to catch rain in my jaws
what is born now what wrests its way
out of the eternal feminine the body

Hayan ChararaAnimals"The phone call from my wife
She’s hungry she’s pregnant
someone kicked her

in the stomach—we have to
I say yes but the reply
I keep to myself is

We don’t have to do a goddamn thing
A dog I’m talking about a dog
I would have otherwise left to starve

Now though five years since
I love this animal Lucy
more than I can most people

A boy names his dog and five cats
after our Lucy The boy my brother
born in Henry Ford’s hometown

lives now in Lebanon
which the Greeks called Phoenicia
and they tried but failed

to subdue it same as the Egyptians
Hittites Assyrians Babylonians
Alexander the Great Romans Arabs

Crusaders Turks the British
the French the Israelis
There my father built a house

with money earned in Detroit—
as a grocer with social security
Also there the first alphabet

was created the first law school built
the first miracle of Jesus—
water wine

•

On the first day
the bombs fall they flee
and the boy asks

to go back for Lucy
the dog As for the cats
No They take care of themselves

One week into it
he wonders who feeds them
who fills the water bowls

Maybe the neighbors
the mother thinks out loud
The father is indignantNeighbors—

what neighbors They’re gone
The mother is stunned
What do you mean gone

After a month everyone forgets
or just stops talking about
the animals During the ceasefire

my father drives south
a thirty-minute trip that lasts
six hours—wreckage upon wreckage

piled on the roads on what is left
of the roads The landscape
entirely gray so catastrophic

he asks a passerby how far
to his town and is told
You’re in it

 •

My father finds three of the cats
all perforated one headless
The dog is near the carport

where it hid during lightning storms
its torso splayed in half
like meat on a slab its entrails

eaten by other dogs
scavenging on the streets
Look They’re animals

Which is to say there are also people
And I haven’t even begun telling you
what was done to them"
Charles Harper WebbThe Animals are Leaving"One by one like guests at a late party

Atlas bear Passenger pigeon North Island laughing owl
Great auk Dodo Eastern wapiti Badlands bighorn sheep"
Margaret AtwoodThe animals in that country"In that country the animals
have the faces of people

the ceremonial
cats possessing the streets

the fox run
politely to earth the huntsmen
standing around him fixed
in their tapestry of manners

the bull embroidered
with blood and given
an elegant death trumpets his name
stamped on him heraldic brand
because

when he rolled
on the sand sword in his heart the teeth
in his blue mouth were human

he is really a man

even the wolves holding resonant
conversations in their
forests thickened with legend

In this country the animals
have the faces of
animals

Their eyes
flash once in car headlights
and are gone

Their deaths are not elegant

They have the faces of
no-one"
Tom SleighThe Animals in the Zoo Don’t Seem Worried"Looking at the lion behind the plate glass
I wasn’t sure what I was looking at a lion OK
but he seemed to come apart not literally

I mean but I couldn’t see him whole
Mane Teeth The slung belly pumping
as he panted and began to roar His balls

sheathed in fur swaying a little His tail’s tuft
jerking in an arc like an old-time pump handle
rusted in midair Somebody or something

I read once said that when Jesus had his vision
of what his father God would do to him
that Jesus could only see pieces of a cross

pieces of a body appearing through flashes
of sun as if the body in his vision
was hands looking for feet a head for a torso

everything come unmagnetized from the soul
the lion caught me in his stare not at
or through me but fixated on the great chain

of being that Jesus couldn’t see and that
a zebra might gallop in — black and white stripes
marking longitudes of this world turning

to meat bloody meat — this vision of an inmate
that Jesus’s father helped to orchestrate by
making a cageless cage with glass instead

of bars — though the lion didn’t seem to care
he was roaring for his keepers to bring
him food so everything’s what it should be

if you’re a lion Nor did the sea lion
seem concerned about having gone a little
crazy barking incessantly so I could see

the plush hot pink insides of its throat
though like the lion through the glass
there’s this distortion my reflection

I’m looking through that makes me float above
the zoo and now this silence at closing time
pours like a waterfall in different zones

of silences that pouring through my head
surround roaring barking human muttering —
is any of that what being sounds like

Or is it just animal gasping like what
Jesus must have heard from the thieves
hanging beside him one damned one saved

What was in his heart when his vision
clarified and he saw it was a hand he
recognized that the nail was driving through"
W S MerwinThe Animals"All these years behind windows
With blind crosses sweeping the tables

And myself tracking over empty ground
Animals I never saw

I with no voice

Remembering names to invent for them
Will any come back will one

Saying yes

Saying look carefully yes
We will meet again"
Josephine JacobsenThe Animals"At night alone the animals came and shone
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals
The lion the man the calf the eagle saying
Sanctus which was and is and is to come

The sleeper watched the people at the waterless wilderness’ edge
The wilderness was made of granite of thorn of death
It was the goat which lightened the people praying
The goat went out with sin on its sunken head

On the sleeper’s midnight and the smaller after hours
From above below elsewhere there shone the animals
Through the circular dark the cock appeared in light
Crying three times for tears for tears for tears

High in the frozen tree the sparrow sat At three o’clock
The luminous thunder of its fall fractured the earth
The somber serpent looped its coils to write
In scales the slow snake-music of the red ripe globe

To the sleeper alone the animals came and shone
The darkness whirled but silent shone the animals
Just before dawn the dove flew out of the dark
Flying with green in her beak the dove also had come"
Hilda Raz"Anna Maria Is Coming or Maybe Thomas Barton or Max""New life Will he toe out like Dolly like John Will her eyes be fires
Blue and green like Papas the ocean at the shore
Will she sing in the bath Play piano in her diapers
Will her heart leap at large machinery Will he say ""Dribe dribe""
to his daddy entering the tunnel Will his hair be red Will her hair curl
Will her little face have the circumflex eyebrows of her mother
The pointed chin
Her hair be fair bright blonde Will she frown at the light by the river
Oh let her head fill with Greek Owls her mouth with honey wine
Let his hands cup the keys the air of the studio filling with sound the crunch of
cornflakes the sift of raw sugar on the tongue the great chords

And let the parents be fierce forever Lord as You are exacting
price and penalty for Your gifts so they grow strong and joyous
blessed by the memory of the black car open to air
chosen by a child in token of the power they give over
their lives in service to new life the great melt of petals under snow the green rising"
Edgar Allan PoeAnnabel Lee"It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels not half so happy in Heaven
Went envying her and me—
Yes—that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we—
Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so all the night-tide I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride
In her sepulchre there by the sea—
In her tomb by the sounding sea"
Ruth StaceyAnne Boleyn"Deer do not tremble I know this
My bone and sinew twisted into fallow
slenderness and the tibia twig thin

Four rods finished with a cloven
hoof planted on rotting leaf mould
gloomy weight of the gold altar

The poets words are wind-blown apples
Plucked lute strings vibrate to silence
as I watch Caesar with my velvet eyes

long ears poised to absorb
the rush of animal clamour that is hushed
in the shells of human skulls

Despite the blood threat of power
my doe body would not spring away —
no flick of spotted fur into shadow"
Andrew MotionAnne Frank Huis"Even now after twice her lifetime of grief
and anger in the very place whoever comes
to climb these narrow stairs discovers how
the bookcase slides aside then walks through
shadow into sunlit room can never help

but break her secrecy again Just listening
is a kind of guilt the Westerkirk repeats
itself outside as if all time worked round
towards her fear and made each stroke
die down on guarded streets Imagine it—

four years of whispering and loneliness
and plotting day by day the Allied line
in Europe with a yellow chalk What hope
she had for ordinary love and interest
survives her here displayed above the bed

as pictures of her family some actors
fashions chosen by Princess Elizabeth
And those who stoop to see them find
not only patience missing its reward
but one enduring wish for chances

like my own to leave as simply
as I do and walk at ease
up dusty tree-lined avenues or watch
a silent barge come clear of bridges
settling their reflections in the blue canal"

Wedded to him not through union
But through separation

Thom GunnThe Annihilation of Nothing"Nothing remained Nothing the wanton name
That nightly I rehearsed till led away
To a dark sleep or sleep that held one dream

In this a huge contagious absence lay
More space than space over the cloud and slime
Defined but by the encroachments of its sway

Stripped to indifference at the turns of time
Whose end I knew I woke without desire
And welcomed zero as a paradigm

But now it breaks—images burst with fire
Into the quiet sphere where I have bided
Showing the landscape holding yet entire

The power that I envisaged that presided
Ultimate in its abstract devastations
Is merely change the atoms it divided

Complete in ignorance new combinations
Only an infinite finitude I see
In those peculiar lovely variations

It is despair that nothing cannot be
Flares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark
Of dread
Look upward Neither firm nor free

Purposeless matter hovers in the dark"
Thomas McGrathAnniversaries"for Don and Henrie Gordon
Forty-odd years ago—
Headlines in the snow—
The jobless scrawled a text for mutineers
Then history seemed sane
Though Franco sailed for Spain
And Hitler swore to live a thousand years

Now Progress his machine
Makes water out of wine
With loaves and paper stuffs the multitude
For power he milks the sun
To see the cities flame
And drives the Goddess from the sacred wood

Yet anniversaries
Should have our praise as trees
Salute the queenly coming of the Spring
All sacred marriages
Keep evergreen in this
Coupling with Time they bind him in a ring

Though time turns history moves
As if to prove our loves
Having no pattern but the one we give
While countries bleed and burn
Not any shall sleep warm
Unless good friends you teach us how to live

A pulse-beat of the stars
Astounds the May Fly’s million generations
Your middle style of Time
Is suited most to man
This whispering wrist sustains the dream of nations"

For yourself chaos without demand
To speak the amethyst nothing

Footnotes a margin left blank You
Don’t look up to look up at the sky
Your ears parenthesize nothing
That occurs that I keep from occurring
In the poem on the page as you are
For me not a shadow but a shade
Whose darkness drops from no object
But is itself yourself a form of time
Spanning nothing never is your name"

The dancing doll split in an anguish and all
the cords of its elegant limbs unstrung I
stumble whistling the bones of my skull
marvelously start to sing the whole shell
of myself invents without peril and contains a court aubade

I hid the dovesmall doll but something found it Frightened
I gave the fire what was left Surrounding it mulled
dulcet over the melting jeweled two blue eyes
That night our hearth was desolate but then its stones
sprung flowered and the soaring rafters arched

Now all the house laughs the sun shouts out clearly dawn

And weren’t we gentle and awed and afraid

into the further room of love
And wasn’t it sacred the sweetness

Alicia OstrikerThe Anniversary"Of course we failed by succeeding
The fiery cherub becomes his smothering
A greedy heart dives into a dream

When love was war you swore you’d burn
Your life and die at thirty-five I said good riddance
Bright hairy boy I will beat you down
Tear you to monkey shreds survive like earth
Owl-eyed because I wanted to see everything
Black and permanent and kill you with your theories
We used to wake up sweaty and entangled

Thirty home and work We cohabit in a functioningmachine
There is violence somewhere else Do we wish this Itoccurs
The flayed combatant the dismembered child
The instruments in the basement We must wish it See

Only our love hath no decay
This no tomorrow hath nor yesterday
Running it never runs from us away
But truly keeps his first last everlasting day

Two graves must hide thine and my corse
If one might death were no divorce
Alas as well as other Princes we
Who Prince enough in one another be
Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears
Oft fed with true oaths and with sweet salt tears
But souls where nothing dwells but love
All other thoughts being inmates then shall prove
This or a love increasèd there above
When bodies to their graves souls from their graves remove

And then we shall be throughly blessed
But we no more than all the rest
Here upon earth we’re Kings and none but we
Can be such Kings nor of such subjects be
Who is so safe as we where none can do
Treason to us except one of us two
True and false fears let us refrain
Let us love nobly and live and add again
Years and years unto years till we attain
To write threescore this is the second of our reign"

I am building up evidence Some bodily Some constructed
On balance perhaps I am more a person who racks up
indicators of taste as proof of living There are condiments
playlists preferred linens I first got drunk
on Cinzano There was no one taking notes I used to dream
of sex in a fully upholstered room with no windows or doors
This idea of rabbit fur rugs and buttoned velvet cushions
immaculately conceived Always snagged on the detail
of things — how even did I come to be inside
nevermind out The sex wasn’t the point What I seek
is magic like an intact lipstick mirror in an antique handbag

a gulping heart within a privet hedge Or the druzy quartz

I am dying to be written about in your diary
and my self-involvement extends to endless
photographs of my eye makeup which might be described
as “signature” FYI I prefer a fine brush to a pen
What can be said about slush about the corners cut when cleaning
the fridge What can be said about what is considered
to be ordinary Crucially love is a desire
to be a witness and be witnessed how you might skate
past the provisionalIf the house were burning down
I would rescue all the photographs"
Norman DubieAn Annual of the Dark Physics"The Baltic Sea froze in  Birds flew north
From the Mediterranean in early January
There were meteor storms throughout Europe

On the first day of Lent
Two children took their own lives
Their bodies
Were sewn into goatskins
And were dragged by the hangman’s horse
The three miles down to the sea
They were given a simple grave in the sand

The following Sunday Meister Eckhart
Shouted that a secret word
Had been spoken to him He preached

That Mary Magdalene
Sought a dead man in the tomb
But in her confusion found
Only two angels laughing  

This was a consequence of her purity

And her all too human grief
The Baltic Sea
Also froze in —
Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry"
C Dale YoungAnnunication"I learned to hide my wings almost immediately
learned to tuck and bandage them down
Long before the accident before the glass shattering
and that scene going dim dimmer and then dark
before the three fractures at the axis three cracks

in the bone it had already begun My voice
had begun to deepen the sound of it
suddenly more my fathers than my own My beard
had started growing my bones growing my bones
sore from the speed of their growth and there

at fourteen years of age the first tugging
of the muscles between my shoulder blades
It began as a tiny ache It was just a minor irritation
Day after day passed and this ache grew
and then the tips of the cartilaginous wings

began to tent my skin Father Callahan
had already warned that in each of us
there was both potential for bad and good
When trying to shave for the first time I nicked
my cheek the bleeding slow but continuous

Standing there dabbing at this small cut with tissue paper
the first tear surprised me the left wing heaving through
that fleshy mound of muscle between my shoulder blades
and then the skin I buckled and on my knees the right wing
presented itself more rapidly than the left

When I stood there in the mirror my wings outstretched
with their tiny feathers wet almost glutinous a quick
ribbon of blood snaking down my back You wonder
why I am such a master of avoidance such a master
of what is withheld Is there any wonder now

I had no idea then they would wither and fall off
in a few weeks When Father Callahan patted
my head in the sacristy and told me I was
a good boy a really good boy an extraordinary boy
I wanted to be anything but extraordinary"
Anita EndrezzeAnonymous Is Coyote Girl"From a newspaper photo and article about my godfather James Moreno East Los Angeles 

Three police officers took a brutal beating in a wild free-for-all with a
family including three young girls
From left James  and Alex  in jail after the fracas
on the porch of their home at  Hunter

Jimmy is staring off the page hands in his pockets
A four-button dark shirt No bruises
but he looks dazed
Alex wears a leather coat and a polka-dot shirt
which is in itself a crime
Nowhere is there a photo of a young girl
with a face carved like a racetrack saint
eyes with all bets called off
grinning like a coyote

Officer Parks had his glasses broken
with his own sap
and was thrown through a window

Jimmy and Alex are my dad’s cousins
lived on Boyle Heights and tortillas
Mama says the cops always harassed them those niños
from East LA driving their low-riders
chrome shinier than a cop’s badge
And why wasn’t Coyote Girl mentioned that round-armed
girl with a punch like a bag of bees
a girl with old eyes her lips cracking open
as she saw the cop sailing through glass boiling out
of Boyle Heights skidding on the sidewalk flat as a tortilla

The officers received severe cuts and bruises
were treated at a hospital and released in time to jail the youths
who were charged with assault with a deadly weapon

Two years later I was born and Jimmy entered the church
hands in his pockets shoulders hunched watching the christening
Four drops of water like popped-off wafer-thin buttons
fell on my head
No
He never showed up that day
or any other My spiritual guardian must’ve been there
in spirit only
He didn’t know nada about Got and no one knows
where he is today but I think you could find him at the end
of a knife Or in the slash of the z
in ¡La Raza the dark blood
reds of graffiti Or tomatoes
grown in old coffee cans
by a white-haired man
sitting in the sun in a dark shirt
next to an old woman growing younger every day
as I tell her story my story
our story
with all the grace and power
of a deadly weapon"
Connie VoisineAnonymous Lyric"It was the summer of  when I saw the moon fall down

It broke like a hen’s egg on the sidewalk

The garden roiled with weeds hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my

oblivious siblings

A great hunger insatiate to find / A dulcet ill an evil sweetness blind

A gush of yolk and then darker

Somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a Chevy Impala—vinyl seats the rear- view

headrests and you your hand through your hair

An indistinguishable burning failing bliss

Because the earth’s core was cooling all animals felt the urge to wander

Wash down this whisper of you the terrible must

Maybe the core wasn’t cooling but I felt a coolness in my mother

That girl was shining me on

In blue crayon the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room

I wrote the word LAVA on my jeans

It must be the Night Fever I sang with the -track

But the moon had not broken on the sidewalk the moon

was hot bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door

tied up in sorrow lost in my song if you don’t come back   

and that serious night cooled settling like sugar on our lawn

I wrote the word SUGAR on my palms

I shall say what inordinate love is

The moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair"
ML SmokerAnother Attempt at Rescue"The time is important here—not because this
has been a long winter or because it is my first
at home since childhood—but because there is so much
else to be unsure of We are on the brink of an invasion
At a time like this how is it that when I left only a week ago
there was three feet of snow on the ground
and now there is none not even a single patch
on in the shadow of the fence-line
And to think I paid a cousin twenty dollars
to shovel the walk He and two of his buddies
still smelling of an all-nighter arrived at  am
to begin their work When I left them a while later
and noticed their ungloved hands winter made me feel
selfish and unsure This ground seems unsure
of itself for its own reasons

and we do not gauge enough of our lives
by changes in temperature
When I first began to write poems
I was laying claim to battle
It started with a death that I tried to say
was unjust not because of the actual
dying but because of what was left
What time of year was that
I have still not yet learned to write of war
I have friends who speak out—as is necessary—
with subtle and unsubtle force
But I am from this place and a great deal
has been going wrong for some time now
The two young Indian boys who almost drowned
last night in the fast-rising creek near school
are casualties in any case
There have been too many just like them
and I have no way to fix these things

A friend from Boston wrote something to me last week
about not having the intelligence
to take as subject for his poems
anything other than his own life
For a while now I have sensed this in my own mood
This poem was never supposed to mention
itself other writers or me
But I will not regret that those boys made it home
or that the cousins used the money at the bar
Still there are no lights on this street
Still there is so much mud outside
that we carry it indoors with us"
Jim HarrisonAnother Country"I love these raw moist dawns with
a thousand birds you hear but cant
quite see in the mist
My old alien body is a foreigner
struggling to get into another country
The loon call makes me shiver
Back at the cabin I see a book
and am not quite sure what that is"
Jericho Brown"Another Elegy ""This is what our dying looks like""""This is what our dying looks like
You believe in the sun I believe
I cant love you Always be closing
Said our favorite professor before
He let the gun go off in his mouth
I turned  the way any man turns
In his sleep unaware of the earth
Moving beneath him its plates in
Their places a dated disagreement
Lets fight it out baby You have
Only so long left—a man turning
In his sleep—so I take a picture
I wont look at it of course Its
His bad side his Mr Hyde the hole
In a husbands head the O
Of his wifes mouth Every night
I take a pill Miss one and Im gone
Miss two and were through Hotels
Bore me unless I get a mountain view
A room in which my cell wont work
And theres nothing to do but see
The sun go down into the ground
That cradles us as any coffin can"
Ruth StoneAnother Feeling"Once you saw a drove of young pigs
crossing the highway One of them
pulling his body by the front feet
the hind legs dragging flat
Without thinking
you called the Humane Society
They came with a net and went for him
They were matter of fact uniformed
there were two of them
their truck ominous with a cage
He was hiding in the weeds It was then
you saw his eyes He understood
He was trembling
After they took him you began to suffer regret
Years later you remember his misfit body
scrambling to reach the others
Even at this moment your heart
is going too fast your hands sweat"
Robert HerrickAnother Grace for a Child"Here a little child I stand
Heaving up my either hand
Cold as paddocks though they be
Here I lift them up to Thee
For a benison to fall
On our meat and on us allAmen"
Richard MichelsonAnother Holocaust Poem"I

I watch them line up ark-like two by two chatting quietly and
after the teacher passes one pushes and the one pushed begins
the chase This is how the orphans marched through Warsaw in 
I tell the behaved ones orderly and under orders And Im about to
begin that horrific story the one they dont yet know when I pause
to open the door for a little air And there they are again arms akimbo
like two stooges the Angel of Death and the Angel of Forgetfulness
those vaudeville comics those incorrigible face-making kids
stuck forever—you first—no you—in the undersized doorframe
of the museum I will for lack of a better word call childhood

II

Did I say Angels Clearly I meant my great-aunts whom you havent
yet met My sister called them From-This-You-Shouldnt-Know
and May-You-Never-Forget I preferred Horseradish and Charoset
that bittersweet matzoh sandwich munched at Pesach between prayers
Everyone I knew was still alive and no one cared that in Venice
that very summer Ginsberg in the name of the Jews forgave Pound
Hadnt Id forgone my own bar mitzvah for a weekend in Miami Beach
where that borscht-belt-south social director and shuffleboard champ
first shticked Theres Noah business like Shoah business soon after
Lillian Hellman ushered her de-judaicized Anne Frank onto the stage

III

Are you writing another Holocaust poem my son asks
Hes gauging my anger at this interruption—a love sonnet
less so—but it takes eight dollars of gas just to get to his
summer jobTo Hell with the poem I need me some shekels
he sings misquoting both Ravikovitch and Snoop Dogg Poetry
was nowhere in my fathers house or money either our doorposts
marked pass-over although in a pinch Dad could recite Kiplings
""Gunga Din"" Make fun if you must my mother says but look in
the mirror and Im here to tell you that your father was a better man
than all those anti-Semitic Pounds and Eliots rolled up into one

IV

That was twenty-three years ago before my mother cradling
his neck and not yet crying waited while in East New York
the ambulance raced and the Angel of Death loitered
Are you comfortable she asks adjusting my fathers pillow
while he ever the emcee mimics Henny Youngmans I make
a living Poetry makes nothing happen Auden might repeat
were he here and what wouldnt I give at this moment
for his stiff British upper lip Whats one more death in the family
Otto Frank argues expunging not grief but sex from his daughters
diary and what parent today would dare to play jury or judge

V

Are you writing another Holocaust poem the Angel of Consciousness
who sits while I muse on my right shoulder and whom I often confuse
with her errant two-headed twin the Angel of Conscience asks
And now Im recalling my home office the Akeidah above the desk
the knife blade drawn downward that Angel whats her name
restraining Abrahams implausibly blood-stained arm And because
I exiled to the basement when my Isaac arrived overlooked
that drawing it hung ten months above my newborn sons head
I feel wicked sleeping in this warm bed my daughter proclaims
rehearsing her Anne Frank and pausing anxiously for applause

VI

Burn everything after Im dead Kafka said poking his prewar
Jewish head into yet one more of my poems Hes trying to explain
the fatherland to the fatherless No one reads poetry anymore anyway
my mother quoting from her own unpublished diary writesAnd who
doesnt want to go on living even after death"
Gerald SternAnother Insane Devotion"This was gruesome—fighting over a ham sandwich
with one of the tiny cats of Rome he leaped
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half
hung on my shirt and coat I tore it apart
and let him have his portion I think I lifted him
down sandwich and all on the sidewalk and sat
with my own sandwich beside him maybe I petted
his bony head and felt him shiver I have
told this story over and over some things
root in the mind his boldness of course was frightening
and unexpected—his stubbornness—though hunger
drove him mad It was the breaking of boundaries
the sudden invasion but not only that it was
the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didn’t
run into an alley or into a cellar
he sat beside me eating and I didn’t run
into a trattoria say shaking
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek sobbing
but not only that I had gone there to eat
and wait for someone I had maybe an hour
before she would come and I was full of hope
and excitement I have resisted for years
interpreting this but now I think I was given
a clue or I was giving myself a clue
across the street from the glass sandwich shop
That was my last night with her the next day
I would leave on the train for Paris and she would
meet her husband Thirty-five years ago
I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms we were
dying together we never met again
although she was pregnant when I left her—I have
a daughter or son somewhere darling grandchildren
in Norwich Connecticut or Canton Ohio
Every five years I think about her again
and plan on looking her up The last time
I was sitting in New Brunswick New Jersey
and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton
if she was still married or still alive and tried
calling I went that far We lived
in Florence and Rome We rowed in the bay of Naples
and floated naked on the boards I started
to think of her again today I still
am horrified by that cat’s hunger I still
am puzzled by the connection This is another
insane devotion there must be hundreds although
it isn’t just that there is no pain and the thought
is fleeting and sweet I think it’s my own dumb boyhood
walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning
stupid eyes I think I gave the cat
half of my sandwich to buy my life I think
I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice
It was this I bought the red coleus
the split rocking chair the silk lampshade
Happiness I watched him with pleasure
I bought memory I could have lost it
How crazy it sounds His face twisted with cunning
The wind blowing through his hair His jaws working"

Howard MossAnother Life"There might be the quibble of birds and the swag
Of a river and a distantly belled
Altar of animals softly spoken
Certainly cattail sumac and fern
Would rise from the marshes nearby revealed
In forms too perfect to envy trees—
Not trying for larger and larger keepsakes

Cryptic and subtle green hedgerows
Hiding mysterious deer the start
Of a rabbit as if towers and clouds
Had suddenly shadowed an open field—
These would be the events of the day
Life having narrowed down to please
Natural hungers and thirsts the grass
Thick at our feet and above our heads
The stars their fireworks anemones

What shall I say of the house Or you
Only industrious ghosts would know
How lazily cropping up the view
Would make the impossible possible
Nothing but weekdays would blankly graze
On time’s oblivious pastures free
At last of motive and thought and we
Becoming ourselves so naturally
Would never say looking up at the sky
Another life is shining in the sky"
A E StallingsAnother Lullaby for Insomniacs"Sleep she will not linger
She turns her moon-cold shoulder
With no ring on her finger
You cannot hope to hold her

She turns her moon-cold shoulder
And tosses off the cover
You cannot hope to hold her
She has another lover

She tosses off the cover
And lays the darkness bare
She has another lover
Her heart is otherwhere

She lays the darkness bare
You slowly realize
Her heart is otherwhere
Theres distance in her eyes

You slowly realize
That she will never linger
With distance in her eyes
And no ring on her finger"
Zack StraitAnother Moon"Mama said
it only existed in storybooks

with its soft surface
of  bluebells

but there it was
spinning so close to the earth

that it bent
every weather vane in Omaha

it was prom night

and I thought I’d pluck a few
trumpets

to bring your Grandma

so I pulled our red ladder out
of  the garage

and climbed to the roof

I stood up
and imagined I was balancing

the moon on my head

the narrow windows of  Union
Station

gleamed like ice chips

and the thin faces of the clock
tower told me

it was almost eight

I was going to be late picking
Nancy up

if  I didn’t get a move on

so I snipped off the best stems
and hurried

back down to my Ford

I sped through every stop sign
on my way

to her parents’ house

she was waiting with her arms
crossed

trying not to look upset

I think she thought
she was going to get stood up

so when I popped open
the door

and told her to get in
she couldn’t help smiling a bit

she asked
what’d taken me so long

and I figured I should go ahead

and give her the flowers
I’d brought her

I’d set them
back behind the steering wheel

to not ruin the surprise

I told her she was the princess
and I was the knight

who rode into the stars

so he could flare
their notes to her on a blue horn"
Galway KinnellAnother Night in the Ruins"
In the evening
haze darkening on the hills
purple of the eternal
a last bird crosses over
‘flop flop’ adoring
only the instant


Nine years ago
in a plane that rumbled all night
above the Atlantic
I could see lit up
by lightning bolts jumping out of it
a thunderhead formed like the face
of my brother looking down
on blue
lightning-flashed moments of the Atlantic


He used to tell me
“What good is the day
On some hill of despair
the bonfire
you kindle can light the great sky—
though it’s true of course to make it burn
you have to throw yourself in ”


Wind tears itself hollow
in the eaves of these ruins ghost-flute
of snowdrifts
that build out there in the dark
upside-down ravines
into which night sweeps
our cast wings our ink-spattered feathers


I listen
I hear nothing Only
the cow the cow of such
hollowness mooing
down the bones


Is that a
rooster He
thrashes in the snow
for a grain Finds
it Rips
it into
flames Flaps Crows
Flames
bursting out of his brow


How many nights must it take
one such as me to learn
that we aren’t after all made
from that bird that flies out of its ashes
that for us
as we go up in flames our one work
is
to open ourselves to be
the flames"
Dunya MikhailAnother Planet"I have a special ticket
to another planet
beyond this Earth
A comfortable world and beautiful
a world without much smoke
not too hot
and not too cold
The creatures
are gentler there
and the governments
have no secrets
The police are nonexistent
there are no problems
and no fights
And the schools
don’t exhaust their students
with too much work
for history has yet to start
and there’s no geography
and no other languages
And even better
the war
has left its “r
”
behind
and turned into love
so the weapons sleep
beneath the dust
and the planes pass by
without shelling the cities
and the boats
look like smiles
on the water
All things
are peaceful
and kind
on the other planet
beyond this Earth
But still I hesitate
to go alone"
Rebecca HoogsAnother Plot Cliché"My dear you are the high-speed car chase and I
I am the sheet of glass being carefully carried
across the street by two employees of Acme Moving
who have not parked on the right side
because the plot demands that they make
the perilous journey across traffic
and so they are cursing as rehearsed
as they angle me into the street acting as if
they intend to get me to the department store as if
I will ever take my place as the display window ever clear
the way for a special exhibit at Christmas or be Windexed
once a day or even late at night be pressed against
by a couple who can’t make it back to his place
and so they angle me into the street a bright lure
a provocative claim their teaser and indeed
you can’t resist my arguments fatally flawed
though they are so you come careening to but and butt
and rebut you come careening you being
both cars both chaser and chased both good and bad both
done up with bullets that haven’t yet done you in
I know I’m done for there’s only one street
on this set and you’ve got a stubborn streak a mile long
I can smell the smoke already
No matter I’d rather shatter
than be looked through all day So come careening I know
you’ve other clichés to hammer home women with groceries
to send spilling canals to leap as the bridge is rising
And me I’m so through I’ve got a thousand places to be"
Annie FinchAnother Reluctance"Chestnuts fell in the charred season
Fell finally finding room
In air to open their old cases
So they gleam out from the gold leaves
In the dusk now where they dropped down

I go watch them waiting for winter
Their husks open and holding on
Those rusted rims are rigid=hard
And cling clean to the clear brown

And the fall sun sinks soon
And the day draws to its dark end
and the feet give up the gray walk
no longer lingering light gone
and I am here and do not go home

Hollow gifts to cold children
The chestnuts they hid in small caches
Have gone hollow their gleam gone
Their grain gone and the children are home"

Lisa Olstein"Another Story with a Burning Barn in It
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""I was on the porch pinching back the lobelia
like trimming a great blue head of hair

We’d just planted the near field the far one
the day before I’d never seen it so clear

so gusty so overcast so clear so calm
They say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster

and that morning I happened to remember
so I put them on for milking finding some

sympathy I guess between the two
Usually I don’t sit down until much later in the day

The lobelia was curling in the sun One by one
birds flew off and that should have been a sign

Trust is made and broken I hardly sit down
at all It was the time of year for luna moths

but we hadn’t had any yet settling on the porch
or hovering above the garden I’d let the wild rose take"
Carter RevardAnother Sunday Morning"What I walked down to the highway for
through the summer dawn
was the Sunday funnies
or so I thought—
but what I remember reading there
in the shadowless light
among meadowlarks singing
was tracks in the deep warm dust
of the lane where it parted
with its beige dryness the meadow’s dew—
the sleek trail where a snake had crossed
and slid into tall grass
the stippled parallels
with marks between them where
a black blister-beetle had dragged
its bulbous belly across
in search of weeds more green
the labyrinth of lacelike
dimples left by a speed-freak
tiger-beetles’s sprints that ended
where it took wing
with a little blur of dust-grains
and stepping through the beetle-trails
the wedge-heels and sharp-clawed hands of skunk-track
crossing unhurried and walking
along the ditch to find
an easy place for climbing
not far past that
a line of cat-prints running
straight down the lane and ending
with deep marks where it leaped
across the ditch to the meadow
for birds asleep or wandering baby rabbits
and freshly placed this morning
the slender runes
of bob-whites running scuffles
of dustbaths taken—
and there ahead
crouched low at the lane-edge
under purple pokeweed-berries
four quail had seen me
and when I walked slowly
on toward them instead
of flying they ran
with a fluid scuttling
on down the lane and stopped frozen
till I came too close
—then quietly when
I expected an explosion
of wings they took off low and whispering
and sailed rocking and tilting
out over the meadow’s tall bluestem
dropped down and were gone until
I heard them whistling down by the little pond
and whistled back so sharply
that when I got back to the house
they still were answering
and one flew into the elm
and whistled from its shadows
up over the porch where I sat
reading the funnies while the kittens
played with the headlines
till when the first gold sunlight
tipped the elm’s leaves he flew
back out to the meadow and sank
down into the sun-brilliant dew
on curving wings
and my brothers and sisters waked
by the whistling came pouring out
onto the porch and claimed their share
of the Sunday funnies—
and I went on to read
the headlines of World War Two
with maps of the struggling armies leaving
tank-tracks over the dunes of Libya
and the navies churning their wakes
of phosphorescence in the Coral Sea
where the ships went down on fire
and the waves bobbed and flamed
with the maimed survivors  screaming
in Japanese or English until
their gasoline-blistered heads
sank down to the tiger sharks
and the war was lost or won
for children sitting in sunlight
believing their cause was just
and knowing it would prevail
as the dew vanished away"
David MasonAnother Thing"Like fossil shells embedded in a stone
you are an absence rimmed calligraphy
a mouthing out of silence a way to see
beyond the bedroom where you lie alone
So why not be the vast antipodal cloud
you soloed under riven by cold gales
And why not be the song of diving whales
why not the plosive surf   below the road

The others are one thing They know they are
One compass needle They have found their way
and navigate by perfect cynosure
Go wreck yourself once more against the day
and wash up like a bottle on the shore
lucidity and salt in all you say"
Ailbhe DarcyAnsel Adams’ Aspens"To tiny Ansel Adams newly arrived on this earth
the sky must seem a miracle I’d commit the scene
to black and white if I could the sky bright

and bottomless trees gnarled as the knees of elephants
Helpless in his Biltrite pram Ansel Adams is watching
the clouds roll in Then the clouds would gather speed

roll out again and the camera pan down to Ansel Adams
the man kneeling on granite choosing one filter
over another It’s as though more and greater apparatus

were needed to recapture that first exposure says
the voice-over as though Ansel Adams were a pioneer
toiling after the spirit not just the body of America

To tiny Ansel Adams newly arrived on this earth
the sky must seem a matter of fact It’s the mind
beneath he wants to grasp stowed in its smart black

enclosure I’d have his pram gather speed and transform
a cartoon robot against the heavens wheels spinning
into Ansel Adams’ camera Now the bright black sky

is Ansel Adams and Ansel Adams the filter
light renders each tree a bouquet of paper
the Great Depression gathers like so much weather

To tiny Ansel Adams newly arrived on this earth
the sky is what it is taut with its isness
Some time before dawn the section framed

by interior blackens and brightens and each tree out there
glows with itself with the certainty of all Ansel Adams’
aspens No one is watching but this one bewildered

immigrant toiling after sleep saturated in monochrome
Sometimes it’s all you’ll find in the wilderness Ansel
Adams tiny in his pram composing the day just gone"

And raise your hand
As your name occurred
Anseo meaning here here and now
All present and correct
Was the first word of Irish I spoke
The last name on the ledger
Belonged to Joseph Mary Plunkett Ward
And was followed as often as not
By silence knowing looks
A nod and a wink the Masters droll
And wheres our little Ward-of-court

I remember the first time he came back
The Master had sent him out
Along the hedges
To weigh up for himself and cut
A stick with which he would be beaten
After a while nothing was spoken
He would arrive as a matter of course
With an ash-plant a salley-rod
Or finally the hazel-wand
He had whittled down to a whip-lash
Its twist of red and yellow lacquers
Sanded and polished
And altogether so delicately wrought
That he had engraved his initials on it

I last met Joseph Mary Plunkett Ward
In a pub just over the Irish border
He was living in the open
In a secret camp
On the other side of the mountain
He was fighting for Ireland
Making things happen
And he told me Joe Ward
Of how he had risen through the ranks
To Quartermaster Commandant
How every morning at parade
His volunteers would call back Anseo
And raise their hands
As their names occurred"
Chinua AchebeAnswer"I broke at last
the terror-fringed fascination
that bound my ancient gaze
to those crowding faces
of plunder and seized my
remnant life in a miracle
of decision between white-
collar hands and shook it
like a cheap watch in
my ear and threw it down
beside me on the earth floor
and rose to my feet I
made of their shoulders
and heads bobbing up and down
a new ladder and leaned
it on their sweating flanks
and ascended till midair
my hands so new to harshness
could grapple the roughness of a prickly
day and quench the source
that fed turbulence to their
feet I made a dramatic
descent that day landing
backways into crouching shadows
into potsherds of broken trance I
flung open long-disused windows
and doors and saw my hut
new-sept by rainbow brooms
of sunlight become my home again
on whose trysting floor waited
my proud vibrant life"

To Pope’s Impromptu
Title and Epigraph
This poem is also known by a longer title ""To Mr Pope In answer to a coppy of verses occasiond by a little dispute upon four lines in the Rape of the Lock""

Finch is responding to these four lines from Popes
The Rape of the Lock
first published  finished 
Parent of vapors and of female wit
Who give the hysteric or poetic fit
On various tempers act by various ways
Make some take physic other scribble plays Canto  lines -
Alexander Popes poem ""Impromptu To Lady Winchelsea Occasiond by Four Satyrical Verses on Women-Wits in The Rape of the Lock""
In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore
And cite those Sapphos we admire no more
Fate doomd the Fall of evry Female Wit
But doomd it then when first Ardelia writ
Of all Examples by the World confessd
I knew Ardelia could not quote the best
Who like her Mistress on Britannias Throne
Fights and subdues in Quarrels not her own
To write their Praise you but in vain essay
Evn while you write you take that Praise away
Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore
But shines himself till they are seen no more

""Ardelia"" is Finchs pen-name The poem was written around  and published in Bayles
Dictionary
in 

Pope’s and Finch’s poem share the words ""fate"" and ""world"" and Popes use of ""admire"" is echoed in Finchs use of ""admiration""
Disarmed with so genteel an air
The contest I give o’er
Yet Alexander have a care
And

Echoes the Shock from Popes The Rape of the Lock where the word suggests a military campaign ""Or whether Heaven has doomed that Shock must fall /   / Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock"" Canto  lines   and in Belindas words from Canto  line  ""   Shock was most unkind""

Finch echoes Popes use of “no more” in ""Impromptu"" “In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore / And cite those Sapphos we admire no more“ and “Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore / But shines himself till they are seen no more”

We rule the world our life’s whole race
Men but assume that right
First slaves to ev’ry tempting face

Bei DaoThe Answer"Debasement is the password of the base
Nobility the epitaph of the noble
See how the gilded sky is covered
With the drifting twisted shadows of the dead

The Ice Age is over now
Why is there ice everywhere
The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered
Why do a thousand sails contest the Dead Sea

I came into this world
Bringing only paper rope a shadow
To proclaim before the judgment
The voice that has been judged

Let me tell you world
I—do—not—believe
If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet
Count me as number thousand and one

I dont believe the sky is blue
I dont believe in thunders echoes
I dont believe that dreams are false
I dont believe that death has no revenge

If the sea is destined to breach the dikes
Let all the brackish water pour into my heart
If the land is destined to rise
Let humanity choose a peak for existence again

A new conjunction and glimmering stars
Adorn the unobstructed sky now
They are the pictographs from five thousand years
They are the watchful eyes of future generations"
Sara TeasdaleThe Answer"When I go back to earth
And all my joyous body
Puts off the red and white
That once had been so proud
If men should pass above
With false and feeble pity
My dust will find a voice
To answer them aloud

“Be still I am content
Take back your poor compassion—
Joy was a flame in me
Too steady to destroy
Lithe as a bending reed
Loving the storm that sways her—
I found more joy in sorrow
Than you could find in joy”

Katherine PhilipsAn Answer to Another Persuading a Lady to Marriage"Forbear bold youth all’s Heaven here
And what you do aver
To others courtship may appear
’Tis sacriledge to her

She is a publick deity
And were’t not very odd
She should depose her self to be
A pretty household god

First make the sun in private shine
And bid the world adieu
That so he may his beams confine
In complement to you

But if of that you do despair
Think how you did amiss
To strive to fix her beams which are
More bright and large than this"
Linda PastanThe Answering Machine"I call and hear your voice
on the answering machine
weeks after your death
a fledgling ghost still longing
for human messages

Shall I leave one telling
how the fabric of our lives
has been ripped before
but that this sudden tear will not
be mended soon or easily

In your emptying house others
roll up rugs pack books
drink coffee at your antique table
and listen to messages left
on a machine haunted

by the timbre of your voice
more palpable than photographs
or fingerprints On this first day
of this first fall without you
ashamed and resisting

but compelled I dial again
the number I know by heart
thankful in a diminished world
for the accidental mercy of machines
then listen and hang up"
Matthew FrancisAnt"After Robert Hooke
All afternoon a reddish trickle
out of the roots of the beech

and across the lawn

a sort of  rust that shines and dances
Close up it proves to be ant

each droplet a horned

traveler finicking its way round
the crooked geometry

of a grass forest

A finger felled in their path rocks them
amazed back on their haunches

I see them tasting

the air for subtle intelligence
till one ventures to scale it

and others follow


They are fidgety subjects to draw
If you sink the feet in glue

the rest twists and writhes

kill one the juices evaporate
in seconds leaving only

the shriveled casing

I dunked one in brandy It struggled
till the air rose from its mouth

in pinprick bubbles

I let it soak an hour then dried it
observed the spherical head

the hairlike feelers

the grinning vice of its sideways jaw
the coppery armor plate

with its scattered spines


Some draft stirred it then It rose to all
its feet and set off across

the rough miles of desk"
Thom GunnThe Antagonism"to Helena Shire
The Makers did not make
The muddy winter hardening to privation
Or cholera in the keep or frost’s long ache
Afflicting every mortal nation
From lord to villagers in their fading dyes
—Those who like oxen strained
On stony clearings of the ground
From church to sties

They sought an utterance
Or sunshine soluble in institution
An orthodoxy justified at once
The dream and dreamer warmed in fusion
As in the great Rose Window pieced from duty
Where through Christ’s crimson sun
Shines on your clothes till they take on
Value and beauty

But carved on a high beam
Far in the vault from the official version
Gape gnarled unChristian heads out of whom stream
Long stems of contrary assertion
Shaped leaf ridging their scalps in place of hair
Their origins lost to sight
As they are too cast out from light
They should despair

What stays for its own sake
Occulted in the dark may slip an ending
Recalcitrant and strengthened by the ache
Of winter not for the transcending
Ice and snow pile the gables of the roof
Within whose shade they hold
Intimate with its slaty cold
To Christ aloof"
James HochAntarctica"Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout leaned our heads back
eyes twitching gone and popped nitrous

canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow

ice the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss

we drifted in like dew more like pollen
on our skins and beneath a want
for touch a kiss a return Like nothing

back then to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an Impala or settling back
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge

before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the riverLike this

you said sliding a needle watching
dope plunge the bodys rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel

hovering above but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air Those friends
are gone some dead dying locked up

or jailed in themselves and when I see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them I remember we

wanted only to quiet our bodies their
unnatural hum a vague pull inward
some thin furrows gliding over the snow"
Susan HahnAnthem"After the Fourth of July

On this night of the mid-
summer festival of fire
where liquid explosives
look like the arch and ache
of the willow tree

so near your grave on this
night of the awaiting mid-
wife who lulled you in-
to this world the light
all violet because the Earth and stars
inclined toward each other
she also sleeps she who was
your first deliverer guiding you out

of your mother—her bluing
skin no small sign of the future
cyanosis of her spirit for no
small journey was it to this
country to bring you to birth
in this torch

song heat and an anthem of a free
nations conception of combustions
rosins petroleum tallow arsenic
and worse as you too fell from the sky

of her body with me
a microscopic egg inside—
half the composition
that made up my own
toss and tumble to this crash
of ground I sit over and bless
while you lie under under
the willow under this world
that no midwife
nor wavelength can under-
standably reach So I stand

in this over-
determined fire forced out
like bullets upon a target—
the pulled trigger releasing
the hammer that strikes
the impacted mixture—
hailstorm and hymn

of memories And the outstretched womb
involutes and the abdominal wall tightens
and inside all abandoned encasements
the night over the day darkens"
Wilfred OwenAnthem for Doomed Youth"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle
—Only the monstrous anger of the guns
Only the stuttering rifles rapid rattle
Can patter out their hasty orisons
No mockeries now for them no prayers nor bells
Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs—
The shrill demented choirs of wailing shells
And bugles calling for them from sad shires

What candles may be held to speed them all
Not in the hands of boys but in their eyes
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes
The pallor of girls brows shall be their pall
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds"
Phillis LevinAn Anthology of Rain"For this you may see no need
You may think my aim
Dead set on something

Devoid of conceivable value
An Anthology of  Rain
A collection of voices

Telling someone somewhere
What it means to follow a drop
Traveling to its final place of rest

But do consider this request
If you have pressed your nose
Of any shape against a window

Odor of metal faint persistent
While a storm cast its cloak
Over the shoulder of every cloud

In sight You are free to say
Whatever crosses your mind
When you look at the face of time

In the passing of one drop
Gathering speed one drop
Chasing another racing to reach

A fork in the path lingering
Before making a detour to join
Another fattening on the way

Until entering a rivulet
Running to the sill
So please accept this invitation

You are welcome to submit
There is no limit to its limit
Even the instructions are a breeze

As long as you include
Nothing about yourself
Except your name Your address

Remains unnecessary for the rain
Will find you — if you receive it
It receives you whether or not

You contribute a volume
Is sent And when you lift
The collection you may hear

By opening anywhere a drop
And its story reappear
As air turns to water water to air"

James GalvinAnthropology"Remember the night you got drunk
and shot the roses
You were a perfect stranger Father
even my bad sister cried

Some other gravity
not death or luck
drew fish out of the sea
and started them panting

The fish became a man
The archer’s bow became a violin
I remember the night you searched the sofa
for change

and wept on the telephone
Some other gravity
not time or entropy
pulled the knife down for centuries

The archers dropped their bows
harmless as pine needles in the snow
The knife became a plow
and entered the earth Father

Later it became a boat
and some other things —
It isn’t a dream but it takes a long time
for the archer’s bow to become a violin"
Thomas CentolellaAnti-Elegy"for TNH
There are those who will never return to us
as we knew them Who if they return at all
visit our sleep or daydreams or turn up in the features
of total strangers Or greet us face to face
in the middle of some rush hour street
but from a great distance—and not in the full flush
of bodies that once wanted nothing more from us
than the laying of our hands upon them
as a healer lays hands upon the afflicted
There are those who by their absence are an affliction

I imagine that sometimes in your dark bed
you still want to know why Why the man
you were just coming to love who liked you close
as he raced through the city at night why
he had to swerve suddenly Why he had to end up
on an operating table dead Why you of all people
had to live to repeat this unanswerable question

I could tell you about a woman good at ritual
who hardly believing in herself was good
at making vows the two of us could believe
Then one day I had to drive her to an early flight
The dawn was blinding She was off to look for the soul
no one else could provide But was this the way
to do it She didn’t know She wanted me
to tell her Tears down her face And I kept driving
I can look back and say on that day that’s when I died

Since then you and I have had a hard time believing
anything could bring us back And yet your brown body
breathes new life into a cotton print from the fifties
and picks parsley from the garden for spaghetti carbonara

and cues up Mozart’s French horn solo and fills up the kitchen
with the aroma of sourdough and gets my body to anticipate
the taste of malt as the tops of American beer cans pop
good rituals all because they waited out our every loss patient
with the slow coming back to our senses undeterred by our neglect
As if they knew all along how much we would need them"

Did I tell you my grandfather sings from the grave

Flashy cars on both sides playing radios too loud
Ear damage I used to shout out the window

Charlotte Anna Perkins GilmanThe Anti-Suffragists"Fashionable women in luxurious homes
With men to feed them clothe them pay their bills
Bow doff the hat and fetch the handkerchief
Hostess or guest and always so supplied
With graceful deference and courtesy
Surrounded by their servants horses dogs —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

Successful women who have won their way
Alone with strength of their unaided arm
Or helped by friends or softly climbing up
By the sweet aid of ‘woman’s influence’
Successful any way and caring naught
For any other woman’s unsuccess —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

Religious women of the feebler sort —
Not the religion of a righteous world
A free enlightened upward-reaching world
But the religion that considers life
As something to back out of — whose ideal
Is to renounce submit and sacrifice
Counting on being patted on the head
And given a high chair when they get to heaven —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

Ignorant women — college-bred sometimes
But ignorant of life’s realities
And principles of righteous government
And how the privileges they enjoy
Were won with blood and tears by those before —
Those they condemn whose ways they now oppose
Saying ‘Why not let well enough alone
Our world is very pleasant as it is’ —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

And selfish women — pigs in petticoats —
Rich poor wise unwise top or bottom round
But all sublimely innocent of thought
And guiltless of ambition save the one
Deep voiceless aspiration — to be fed
These have no use for rights or duties more
Duties today are more than they can meet
And law insures their right to clothes and food —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

And more’s the pity some good women too
Good conscientious women with ideas
Who think — or think they think — that woman’s cause
Is best advanced by letting it alone
That she somehow is not a human thing
And not to be helped on by human means
Just added to humanity — an ‘L’ —
A wing a branch an extra not mankind —
These tell us they have all the rights they want

And out of these has come a monstrous thing
A strange down-sucking whirlpool of disgrace
Women uniting against womanhood
And using that great name to hide their sin
Vain are their words as that old king’s command
Who set his will against the rising tide
But who shall measure the historic shame
Of these poor traitors — traitors are they all —
To great Democracy and Womanhood"

Every step you take will be the right one

Women encouraged me like that
Avoiding void no one goes nameless in this world

Power I was the son of a king
Hacking the armor from the limbs of the dying

In the path of the blade of the plough I met God my foe
Oh blight his voyage with trial and calamity

All he needed was a taste of his own medicine
The water was white with the blades of our oars

Long-limbed Circe the troubled could only bring trouble
Sure enough that month became a year

Then Demodocus struck his lyre and sang for me
In that soft song I led one hundred lives

I was young singing such distance when I set out
The meters were my cloak my map my axe

Declensions of the beasts defined my travels
I made the lions purr the lions licked my hands

It was not maya it was not a ladder to perfection
It was this cold sunlight falling on this warm earth

Fled the battle I followed you and lost the world
Without regret but with stormy recriminations

But it takes a Goddess
To get out of one
What’s true of oceans is true of course
Of labyrinths and poems When you start swimming
Through riptide of rhythms and the metaphor’s seaweed
You need to be a good swimmer or a born Goddess
To get back out of them
Look at the sea otters bobbing wildly
Out in the middle of the poem
They look so eager and peaceful playing out there where the
water hardly moves
You might get out through all the waves and rocks
Into the middle of the poem to touch them
But when you’ve tried the blessed water long
Enough to want to start backward
That’s when the fun starts
Unless you’re a poet or an otter or something supernatural
You’ll drown dear You’ll drown
Any Greek can get you into a labyrinth
But it takes a hero to get out of one
What’s true of labyrinths is true of course
Of love and memory When you start remembering"

with up so floating many bells down
spring summer autumn winter
he sang his didn’t he danced his did

Women and menboth little and small
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isn’t they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain

children guessedbut only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
autumn winter spring summer
that noone loved him more by more

when by now and tree by leaf
she laughed his joy she cried his grief
bird by snow and stir by still
anyone’s any was all to her

someones married their everyones
laughed their cryings and did their dance
sleep wake hope and thenthey
said their nevers they slept their dream

stars rain sun moon
and only the snow can begin to explain
how children are apt to forget to remember
with up so floating many bells down

one day anyone died i guess
and noone stooped to kiss his face
busy folk buried them side by side
little by little and was by was

all by all and deep by deep
and more by more they dream their sleep
noone and anyone earth by april
wish by spirit and if by yes

Glyn MaxwellAnything But the Case"Do me my elegy now or Ill scrawl the thing
I scrawl as youre going or screw in a ball when youre gone
Or you and I write unaware in each others tongue
That you or I ever set foot    Or do what our son
And/or little daughter got done got our brilliant names
Pricily grooved in marble by one skilled
In times of loss dream iridescent dreams
Its that first Saturday Let this hour be filled
With anything but the case so that Time the clerk
Goes panting in horror from gremlin to error to glitch
And his screen is stripes and he knows he saved his work
In one of a billion files but fuck knows which
And he lets us alone or at worst as we tiptoe by
Feels were familiar cant for the world say why"
Rae ArmantroutApartment"

The woman on the mantel
who doesnt much resemble me
is holding a chainsaw
away from her body
with a shocked smile
while an undiscovered tumor
squats on her kidney



The present
is a sentimental favorite
with its heady mix
of grandiosity
and abjection
truncated
framed

Even in the dream
Im trying to imagine
which friend

And Im trying to get
all my robes together
robes I really own and
robes I dont"
John CiardiAn Apartment with a View"I am in Rome Vatican bells tolling
a windowful of God and Bernini
My neighbor the Pope has died
and God overnight has wept
black mantles over the sainted
stone age whose skirted shadows
flit through to the main cave

I nurse a cold It must be error
to sniffle in sight of holiness
“Liquids” the doctor said He has
no cure but since I have my choice
I sip champagne If I must sit
dropsical to Heaven let me at least
be ritual to a living water

In the crypt under the cave
the stone box in its stone row
has been marked for months now
My neighbor knew where he was going
I half suspect I too know
and that it is nothing to sneeze at
but am left to sneeze

I drink my ritual Moët et Chandon
and wish my taste being misformed
for the high authentic I had
a California—a Korbel
or an Almaden I like it “forward”
as clerics of such matters say
not schooled to greatness

It is loud in Heaven today
and in the great stone school
my neighbor kept
The alumni procession of saints
is forming for him Bells
clobber the air with portents
I sniffle and sneeze

wad kleenex and sip champagne
trying to imagine what it might be
to take part in a greatness
or even in the illusion
of something like The experience
might deepen my character
though I am already near

the bottom of it among wads and butts
of what was once idea And the last swallow
I do not like the after-taste if that
is what I am tasting But this is ritual
I toast my neighbor may he
find his glass and may its after-taste
be all that he was schooled to"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""Open the window and you want to fly out
though you never actually do—

I think I see you still there on the ledge
where Ive left you

How pulled-awake and flung
can one life be

Again I thought It will end
Again I promised and clung

I learned there that
to cling was in my nature

I think I see you though you flash
quickly through the shutter

I think I hear you though I sleep

Remember this as a bolero
a finite flaring—

both the tulip tree
burning in full bloom

and the weeping silver birch"
Howard AltmannApertures"Old and blind and in love
with light he’d reach for
the hands of writers to guide
him back to the landscape
once the subject of his photo-
graphs Often he’d see just
how hard it was to render it
right and would feel free
of such burdens A last cloud
on a lake he’d let carry him
into night Breaking sounds
of autumn he’d leave a pond
to compose rustling the stream
of images The panicked flight
of the hunted he’d let the dry
grasses capture their golden
yield his release Even in
the crimson cusp of an evening
he’d wedge himself curling
into a ball without twilight
ever sinking him The man
swam with the fog and its
very touch of resolve Further
than any writer his shadows
lapped up the sand All this
in the ebb and flow of a ninth
decade by the tide an inlet
mapped by its egress to the sky
And when moonlight would
come to wash his window
a heavy tome floating lost
worlds on his lap often
his other hand would read
the apertures of old cameras
an author’s intent the subject
of his alignments But when
the milky skies would dip
the hand of a writer in
the milky seas to the light-
house he’d ascend dreaming
of being a writer who was
blind tracing a horizon"

The most devout long to breathe the dirts scent once more

The cat runs faster at night he sees you better

Only the ordinary is reprehensible but praise disgusts the just

Wine is not drunk enough

Be bitter but only about the Truth

With a friend poison is sweet sweetness with an enemy poisons

The colder things are the slower unless they are flowers

You will never know the river wets your hair

What is sweetness that bees do not remember honey

Work is wings

II


If you would judge then be a Judge

If you would be judged be just

The color of a stone is darker in water

To be loved love no one

The catacombs are not the end Past them lies a wall

I am an enemy to what I have forgotten

If a bell rings then a bell has been moved from its sleep

Change admits error but will prove correct in its assumptions

Every antipole is itself Every identity is another

As I walked along the river an old man carried a walking stick on his shoulder as a soldier will carry a rifle When we passed I greeted him but he could not bring himself to answer though I too am an old man taking pains as I go"

The play is predominant the manor-

not even of the rights of humans richer-than-

Hard to think about it and no one knows what to do with it when he has it
So write it out on a billboard that stands under the yellow light of an ""L"" platform among popcorn wrappers and crushed cigars
A poster that says ""Mama I Love Crispy Wafers So""
Leave it on a placard where somebody else gave the blonde lady a pencil moustache and another perplexed citizen deposited
""Jesus Saves Jesus Saves""
One can lay this bundle down there with the others
And never lose it or forget it or want it
""Myrtle loves Harry""
They live somewhere"
Kenneth FearingAphrodite Metropolis "Harry loves Myrtle—He has strong arms from the warehouse
And on Sunday when they take the bus to emerald meadows he doesnt say
""What will your chastity amount to when your flesh withers in a little while""
No
On Sunday when they picnic in emerald meadows they look at the Sunday paper
GIRL SLAYS BANKER-BETRAYER
They spread it around on the grass
BATH-TUB STIRS JERSEY ROW
And then they sit down on it nice
Harry doesnt say ""Ziggins Ointment for withered flesh
Cures thousands of men and women of moles warts red veins flabby throat scalp and hair diseases
Not expensive and fully guaranteed""
No
Harry says nothing at all
He smiles
And they kiss in the emerald meadows on the Sunday paper"

But if memory as if to illustrate
the mind was not yours to have
the mind was not given

in the garden should we not
hate the garden

Peter GizziApocrypha"Wisdom is a kindly spirit but does it love me And righteousness There’s nothing in it
To poetry I leave my senses my deregulation custodial duties and to be a janitor is a great consolation
It gave me my mother back through all her years
To love these children so full of neurons and consciousness What joy to clean up and put a shine on their mess
To my mother I leave my veil my wing the window and time I artifact In this age the hand is a voice
I leave the voice the wonder the mirror and my lens bent and beholden to the worm leaf-work in wrought iron eerie illuminations and deep-sea vision
I’ve seen the Eurostar the drunken boat and Davy Jones’ Locker I’ve seen Spanish galleons and the HS Mauberley covered in brine
There is this line from cloud dander to the solo bulb of mourning a string through common prayer
I like it when the gray-green shadows suddenly dayglo over the rushes The wind in my head
To write is an equal and opposite reaction my comrade communard my friendo
What is it finally thinking what in winter’s dusty alcove the body tocks The day was cloudy The light muddy dreary when they took it down
To Times Roman I give my stammer my sullenness my new world violence form and all that forms and all that paper gusts Little buttress
I send love and weapons to everyone possessed with night visions

I quantified daily the wonder in the grain

Here the days’ mud night is a satellite and anger my cleft my birthmark and star
Anger might be a better way to say “I love you” truer than “how are you in space” Are you cold can I get you a blanket
To the polestar I leave my alien regalia my off-world headdress I leave acoustic forms in time blooming sudsy inconsolable
If you are unsatisfied then welcome
Here there are people working every corner of every inch of grass The meticulously arranged outside reminds me of ocean and feels old
In space the letterforms “I love” oscillate in waves
I lose myself in waves speaking the half of me that forgot to say “goodbye” when I meant to say “how come”
Memory continues to bloom More songs about death and dying songs of inexperience
More songs about being and loss being in loss more songs about seeing and feeling
If you are critical all the better to see and to miss it to misunderstand to fail at empathy and love to not understand love and to love to be diseverything and to love whatever
To mercy I leave whatever"

to a road shack
in Massachusetts
to watch men walk

on the moon We did
the same thing
for three two one
blast off and now

we watch the same men
bounce in and out
of craters I want
a Coke and a hamburger

Because the men
are walking on the moon
which is now irrefutably
not green not cheese

not a shiny dime floating
in a cold blue
the way Id thought
the road shack people dont

notice we are a black
family not from there
the way it mostly goes
This talking through

static bounces in space-
boots tethered

Matthew ArnoldApollo Musagetes"Through the black rushing smoke-bursts
Thick breaks the red flame
All Etna heaves fiercely
Her forest-clothed frame

Not here O Apollo
Are haunts meet for thee
But where Helicon breaks down
In cliff to the sea

Where the moon-silverd inlets
Send far their light voice
Up the still vale of Thisbe
O speed and rejoice

On the sward at the cliff-top
Lie strewn the white flocks
On the cliff-side the pigeons
Roost deep in the rocks

In the moonlight the shepherds
Soft lulld by the rills
Lie wrapped in their blankets
Asleep on the hills

—What forms are these coming
So white through the gloom
What garments out-glistening
The gold-flowerd broom

What sweet-breathing presence
Out-perfumes the thyme
What voices enrapture
The nights balmy prime

Tis Apollo comes leading
His choir the Nine
—The leader is fairest
But all are divine

They are lost in the hollows
They stream up again
What seeks on this mountain
The glorified train—

They bathe on this mountain
In the spring by their road
Then on to Olympus
Their endless abode

—Whose proase do they mention
Of what is it told—
What will be for ever
What was from of old

First hymn they the Father
Of all things and then
The rest of immortals
The action of men

The day in his hotness
The strife with the palm
The night in her silence
The stars in their calm"

The time has come for the nation to turn

a new page by righting wrongs of the past


We apologise for laws and policies that inflicted

profound grief suffering and loss and for the removal

of children from families communities and country


For the pain of these their descendants and for families

left behind to mothers fathers brothers sisters

for indignity inflicted on a proud people we say sorry


We resolve that the injustices of the past must never

never happen again and look to a future based on mutual

respect where all whatever their origins are equal partners

I didn’t know and nobody told me and what
could I do or say anyway

They said you shot the London Ambassador
and when that wasn’t true
they said so
what
They said you shelled their northern villages
and when UN forces reported that was not true
because your side of the cease-fire was holding
since more than a year before
they said so
what
They said they wanted simply to carve
a  mile buffer zone and then
they ravaged your
water supplies your electricity your
hospitals your schools your highways and byways all
the way north to Beirut because they said this
was their quest for peace
They blew up your homes and demolished the grocery
stores and blocked the Red Cross and took away doctors
to jail and they cluster-bombed girls and boys
whose bodies
swelled purple and black into twice the original size
and tore the buttocks from a four month old baby
and then
they said this was brilliant
military accomplishment and this was done
they said in the name of self-defense they said
that is the noblest concept
of mankind isn’t that obvious
They said something about never again and then
they made close to one million human beings homeless
in less than three weeks and they killed or maimed
 of your men and your women and your children

But I didn’t know and nobody told me and what
could I do or say anyway

They said they were victims They said you were
Arabs
They calledyour apartments and gardensguerrilla
strongholds
They calledthe screaming devastation
that they created the rubble
Then they told you to leave didn’t they

Didn’t you read the leaflets that they dropped
from their hotshot fighter jets
They told you to go
One hundred and thirty-five thousand
Palestinians in Beirut and why
didn’t you take the hint
Go
There was the Mediterranean You
could walk into the water and stay
there
What was the problem

I didn’t know and nobody told me and what
could I do or say anyway

Yes I did know it was the money I earned as a poet that
paid
for the bombs and the planes and the tanks
that they used to massacre your family

But I am not an evil person
The people of my country arent so bad

You can expect but so much
from those of us who have to pay taxes and watch
American
TV


You see my point

I’m sorry
I really am sorry"
Joanna KlinkApology"Lately too much disturbed you stay trailing in me
and I believe you How could I not feel
you were misspent there by books stacked clean on glass
or outside the snow arriving as I am still arriving
If the explanations amount to something I will tell you
It is enough you say that surfaces grow so distant
Maybe you darken already too much changed
maybe in your house you would be content where
no incident emerges but for smoke or glass or air
such things held simply to be voiceless
And if you mean me I believe you
Or if you should darken this inwardness would be misspent
and flinching I might pause and add to these meager
incidents the words Some books
should stay formal on the shelves
So surely I heard you in your complication aware
snow holding where it might weightless rest
and should you fold into me—trackless misspent
too much arranged—I might believe you
but swiftly shut lines of smoke rising through snow
here where it seems no good word emerges
Though it is cold I am aware such reluctance
could lose these blinking hours to simple safety
Here is an inwardless purpose
In these hours when snow shuts it may be we empty
amounting to something How could I not
wait for those few words which we might enter"
Ruby RobinsonApology"I can’t go up because I don’t know how

Nobody has shown me
So many names my mother I’m never sure
what to call you So many names for all your predators
and crushes and suitors I’m sorry

I’m sorry I’m here and I’m sorry I’m not here
Would you have made it on your own
without the comorbid condition of motherhood
and the slowness and consistency of time

I’m sorry for the slowness and consistency of time
years like zombies dawdling toward a cliff edge
holding back the child’s writhing body itching to grow packed
around the same mind I have now

I’m sorry the concept of promise outgrew the concept of child
and that systemic contradiction and wizardry left only a dim sense
of suspicion a crescendoing breeze accumulating clouds
amidst bewildering dichotomies

I’m sorry for resembling your relatives and captors and the man
who penetrated you who’s still there communicating boldly
via intersections of others’ thought waves and memories
blatant into the long nights haunting

for my inferiority in the face of nuclear family culture
feeding on detritus of white goods leisure sports laminate ﬂoors
a real home and fake recycling

for creeping by night into a tight void blinds down brain blown
glass-thin electric impulses and bloated thoughts bolted in
For this life being the only one my quiet mind knows

its many versions and phases I’m sorry I wasn’t your daughter
— or anyone — when you were the blue-water navy
or the beheaded or the baby boy Or was I

I’m sorry I was not yet born and could not yet hear you
when you were over there listening carefully
for the rain and small movements of animals for sounds
of life through a green ﬁve-ﬁngered haze

I’m sorry I consider sentiment fact authenticity originality
when they are irrelevant So many choices
in supermarkets the natural habitat of panic attacks
it’s enough to make anyone sorry and I am

I’m sorry it’s taking over half a century to link your purple-patched
brain scan to the basic biology of stress The piano thunders on
sustain pedal wired to the facial muscles of all your neglecters
aching like hell behind their stamina and machinery

I’m sorry I had logically to think of my own self ﬁrst / simultaneously
navigating through the ﬁre and acid of Trust and her sycophant
Love before returning All the powerful were women the power
of penises and facial hair originated there cajoled by matriarchs

As if skin and breath were insigniﬁcant
I’m so sorry
Where are you now to take into my arms and resuscitate
Is it too late given you’re ﬁfty and no longer a child

It’s always mothers and mind control which is why
I thank you for breaking the cycle withstanding the enormity
of generations magnetic as water
to let us go You weren’t to know

about other outrageous families and sadistic counterparts
A nugget of my limbic system remembered choosing my own
lemon-yellow baby clothes so thank you

I squeezed that into the thumb-sized space
in the palm of my hand knowing all along they were wrong
and imploding with it

I’m sorry I wept in the shower for your canceled wedding
letting the violet dress down the plughole unsure
what it all meant except things staying the samefuture
aggravating my brain a baby brother gone again

I’m sorry you were out there alone deﬁned by the worst
of others and deﬁned by your children’s prisms of hope
and survival mechanisms In one version you did marry and lived
in a house with green walls and extravagant furniture

I’m sorry that consensus reality had you set ﬁre to your bed
as you lay in it arrested put in a cell let off the next day
because the lawyer believed it was a genuine attempt
and convinced the police

I’m sorry you’ve had to withstand such torrents
of  knowledgeless advice and legal toxiﬁcation
clinging to reality by a sinew of tooth remembering yourself
through the rough and the smooth

I’m sorry I was absent memorizing books of the Bible
for a bar of Dairy Milk owning up to things
I’d never done getting conﬁrmed as an antidote
to the evil core of me

I’m sorry it was exotic to think of kids like me
ending up in prison coincidentally inevitably
or prevented which is the same salvaged peristalsized
through society brain safely contained

doused daily in cold water or electricity
or disgrace temptations kept consistently far enough away
as to appear illusory

like you my brave mother fantastic prodigy
in ﬂowing white caftan knotted long brown hair a beautiful gaze
of solemnity rare stone emotionless deﬁned by others

I’m sorry I was ill-prepared for your soiled mattress
and comatose body under a wave of advocaat
and transistor radios oozing with cheap Scotch Even I
developed feelings for them amidst adults acting like it’s okay

to leave you this way the blue bottle ﬂies in on it
inﬂated with dog shit and red hot egos resting on your cheek
your lip too cunning to get rid of

I’m sorry that laughing off a difficult childhood
didn’t make it never happen Even a basic calculator
recognizes an inﬁnite loop as a malfunction don’t they see cutting
off my privates every night"
Etheridge KnightApology for Apostasy"Soft songs like birds die in poison air
So my song cannot now be candy
Anger rots the oak and elm roses are rare
Seldom seen through blind despair

And my murmur cannot be heard
Above the din and damn The night is full
Of buggers and bastards no moon or stars
Light the sky And my candy is deferred

Till peacetime when my voice shall be light
Like down lilting in the air then shall I
Sing of beaches white in the magic sun
And of moons and maidens at midnight"
Duchess of Newcastle Margaret CavendishAn Apology For Her Poetry"I language want to dress my fancies in
The hairs uncurled the garments loose and thin
Had they but silver lace to make them gay
Theyd be more courted than in poor array
Or had they art would make a better show
But they are plain yet cleanly do they go
The world in bravery doth take delight
And glistering shows do more attract the sight
And every one doth honor a rich hood
As if the outside made the inside good
And every one doth bow and give the place
Not for the mans sake but the silver lace
Let me intreat in my poor books behalf
That all will not adore the golden calf
Consider pray gold hath no life therein
And life in nature is the richest thing
Be just let Fancy have the upper place
And then my verses may perchance find grace"

bedaubed with bloom Linnaean pentecosts
put their pronged light the chilly fountains burn
Religion of the heart with trysts and quests

and pangs of consolation its hawk’s hood
twitched off for sweet carnality again
rejoices in old hymns of servitude

haunting the sacred well the hidden shrine
It is the ravage of the heron wood
it is the rood blazing upon the green



DAMON’S LAMENT FOR HIS CLORINDA YORKSHIRE 


November rips gold foil from the oak ridges
Dour folk huddle in High Hoyland Penistone
The tributaries of the Sheaf and Don
bulge their dull spate cramming the poor bridges

The North Sea batters our shepherds’ cottages
from sixty miles No sooner has the sun
swung clear above earth’s rim than it is gone
We live like gleaners of its vestiges

knowing we flourish though each year a child
with the set face of a tomb-weeper is put down
for ever and ever Why does the air grow cold

in the region of mirrors And who is this clown
doffing his mask at the masked threshold
to selfless raptures that are all his own



WHO ARE THESE COMING TO THE SACRIFICE


High voices in domestic chapels praise
praise-worthy feuds new-burgeoned spires that sprung
crisp-leaved as though from dropping-wells The young
ferns root among our vitrified tears

What an elopement that was the hired chaise
tore through the fir-grove scattered kinsmen flung
buckshot and bridles and the tocsin swung
from the tarred bellcote dappled with dove-smears

Wires tarnish in gilt corridors in each room
stiff with the bric-a-brac of loss and gain
Love fled truly outwitted through a swirl

of long-laid dust Today you sip and smile
though still not quite yourself Guarding its pane
the spider looms against another storm



A SHORT HISTORY OF BRITISH INDIA I


Make miniatures of the once-monstrous theme
the red-coat devotees melees of wheels
Jagannath’s lovers With indifferent aim
unleash the rutting cannon at the walls

of forts and palaces pollute the wells
Impound the memoirs for their bankrupt shame
fantasies of true destiny that kills
‘under the sanction of the English name’

Be moved by faith obedience without fault
the flawless hubris of heroic guilt
the grace of visitation and be stirred

by all her god-quests her idolatries
in conclave of abiding injuries
sated upon the stillness of the bride



A SHORT HISTORY OF BRITISH INDIA II


Suppose they sweltered here three thousand years
patient for our destruction There is a greeting
beyond the act Destiny is the great thing
true lord of annexation and arrears

Our law-books overrule the emperors
The mango is the bride-bed of light Spring
jostles the flame-tree But new mandates bring
new images of faith good subahdars

The flittering candles of the wayside shrines
melt into dawn The sun surmounts the dust
Krishna from Radha lovingly untwines

Lugging the earth the oxen bow their heads
The alien conscience of our days is lost
among the ruins and on endless roads



A SHORT HISTORY OF BRITISH INDIA III


Malcolm and Frere Colebrooke and Elphinstone
the life of empire like the life of the mind
‘simple sensuous passionate’ attuned
to the clear theme of justice and order gone

Gone the ascetic pastimes the Persian
scholarship the wild boar run to ground
the watercolours of the sun and wind
Names rise like outcrops on the rich terrain

like carapaces of the Mughal tombs
lop-sided in the rice-fields boarded-up
near railway-crossings and small aerodromes

‘India’s a peacock-shrine next to a shop
selling mangola sitars lucky charms
heavenly Buddhas smiling in their sleep’



LOSS AND GAIN


Pitched high above the shallows of the sea
lone bells in gritty belfries do not ring
but coil a far and inward echoing
out of the air that thrums Enduringly

fuchsia-hedges fend between cliff and sky
brown stumps of headstones tamp into the ling
the ruined and the ruinously strong
Platonic England grasps its tenantry

where wild-eyed poppies raddle tawny farms
and wild swans root in lily-clouded lakes
Vulnerable to each other the twin forms

of sleep and waking touch the man who wakes
to sudden light who thinks that this becalms
even the phantoms of untold mistakes



VOCATIONS


While friends defected you stayed and were sure
fervent in reason watchful of each name
a signet-seal’s unostentatious gem
gleams against walnut on the escritoire

focus of reckoning and judicious prayer
This is the durable covenant a room
quietly furnished with stuff of martyrdom
lit by the flowers and moths from your own shire

by silvery vistas frothed with convolvulus
radiance of dreams hardly to be denied
The twittering pipistrelle so strange and close

plucks its curt flight through the moist eventide
the children thread among old avenues
of snowberries clear-calling as they fade



THE LAUREL AXE


Autumn resumes the land ruffles the woods
with smoky wings entangles them Trees shine
out from their leaves rocks mildew to moss-green
the avenues are spread with brittle floods

Platonic England house of solitudes
rests in its laurels and its injured stone
replete with complex fortunes that are gone
beset by dynasties of moods and clouds

It stands as though at ease with its own world
the mannerly extortions languid praise
all that devotion long since bought and sold

the rooms of cedar and soft-thudding baize
tremulous boudoirs where the crystals kissed
in cabinets of amethyst and frost



FIDELITIES


Remember how at seven years the decrees
were brought home child-soul must register
for Christ’s dole be allotted its first Easter
blanch-white and empty chilled by the lilies

betrothed among the well-wishers and spies
Reverend Mother breakfastless could feast her
constraint on terracotta and alabaster
and brimstone and the sweets of paradise

Theology makes good bedside reading Some
who are lost covet scholastic proof
subsistence of probation modest balm

The wooden wings of justice borne aloof
we close our eyes to Anselm and lie calm
All night the cisterns whisper in the roof



IDYLLS OF THE KING


The pigeon purrs in the wood the wood has gone
dark leaves that flick to silver in the gust
and the marsh-orchids and the heron’s nest
goldgrimy shafts and pillars of the sun

Weightless magnificence upholds the past
Cement recesses smell of fur and bone
and berries wrinkle in the badger-run
and wiry heath-fern scatters its fresh rust

‘O clap your hands’ so that the dove takes flight
bursts through the leaves with an untidy sound
plunges its wings into the green twilight

above this long-sought and forsaken ground
the half-built ruins of the new estate
warheads of mushrooms round the filter-pond



THE EVE OF ST MARK


Stroke the small silk with your whispering hands
godmother nod and nod from the half-gloom
broochlight intermittent between the fronds
the owl immortal in its crystal dome

Along the mantelpiece veined lustres trill
the clock discounts us with a telling chime
Familiar ministrants clerks-of-appeal
burnish upon the threshold of the dream

churchwardens in wing-collars bearing scrolls
of copyhold well-tinctured and well-tied
Your photo-albums loved by the boy-king

preserve in sepia waterglass the souls
of distant cousins virgin till they died
and the lost delicate suitors who could sing



THE HEREFORDSHIRE CAROL


So to celebrate that kingdom it grows
greener in winter essence of the year
the apple-branches musty with green fur
In the viridian darkness of its yews

it is an enclave of perpetual vows
broken in time Its truth shows disrepair
disfigured shrines their stones of gossamer
Old Moore’s astrology all hallows

the squire’s effigy bewigged with frost
and hobnails cracking puddles before dawn
In grange and cottage girls rise from their beds

by candlelight and mend their ruined braids
Touched by the cry of the iconoclast
how the rose-window blossoms with the sun"
Nance Van WinckelThe Apophatic"How can it not be
about engine
secret blaze behind
the wheels How not about
this no-way-to-resist seeing
but one side or another
since the rails quite insist
amp irons so right always
running off its own might
How never about freightage
or the outdoor face
in the indoor light
A yesteryears pall
over the day at hand Not
about the passings-by
of nailed-shut houses
amp grouse setting sail
from a rusty swing
How not me out of uniform
out of a sleepers berth
bare amp barely rising
atop smoke amp so little air left
in the soft underbelly
that I may meet—nay embrace—
the hello-goodbye cloud"
Eric NelsonApostrophe to the Apostrophe"Small floater you stay above the fray
a wink at nothings nod a raised brow
watching ps and qs a selfless mote
between I and m a little horn of plenty
spilling plurals disdaining the bottom line

Unlike your twin relatives—groupies of wit
and wisdom hangers on in the smallest talk—
you work alone dark of a crescent moon
Laboring in obscurity you never ask why
never exclaim never tell anyone where to go

Caught up between extremes you are both
a turning away and a stepping forth
a loss and an addition You are the urge
to possess everything and the sure sign
that something is missing"
Samuel MenasheApotheosis"Taut with longing
You must become
The god you sought—
The only one"
Charles WrightThe Appalachian Book of the Dead"Sunday September Sunday  Outdoors
Like an early page from The Appalachian Book of the Dead
Sunlight lavishes brilliance on every surface
Doves settle surreptitious angels on tree limb and box branch
A crow calls deep in its own darkness
Something like water ticks on
Just there beyond the horizon just there steady clock 

Go in fear of abstractions 
Well possibly Meanwhile
They are the strata our bodies rise through the sere veins
Our skins rub off on
For instance whatever enlightenment there might be
Housels compassion and affection those two tributaries
That river above our lives
Whose waters we sense the sense of
late at night and later still

Uneasy suburbanized
I drift from the lawn chair to the back porch to the dwarf orchard
Testing the grass and border garden
A stillness as in the passageways of Paradise
Bell jars the afternoon
Leaves like ex votos hang hard and shine
Under the endlessness of heaven
Such skeletal altars such vacant sanctuary

It always amazes me
How landscape recalibrates the stations of the dead
How what we see jacks up
the odd quotient of what we don’t see
How God’s breath reconstitutes our walking up and walking down
First glimpse of autumn stretched tight and snicked a bad face lift
Flicks in and flicks out
a virtual reality
Time to begin the long division"

hear them cry
the long dead
the long gone
speak to us
from beyond the grave
guide us
that we may learn
all the ways
to hold tender this land
hard clay direct
rock upon rock
charred earth
in time
strong green growth
will rise here
trees back to life
native flowers
pushing the fragrance of hope
the promise of resurrection



such then is beauty
surrendered
against all hope
you are here again
turning slowly
nature as chameleon
all life change
and changing again
awakening hearts
steady moving from
unnamed loss
into fierce deep grief
that can bear all burdens
even the long passage
into a shadowy dark
where no light enters



night moves
through the thick dark
a heavy silence outside
near the front window
a black bear
stamps down plants
pushing back brush
fleeing manmade
confinement
roaming unfettered
confident
any place can become home
strutting down
a steep hill
as though freedom
is all
in the now
no past
no present



earth works
thick brown mud
clinging pulling
a body down
heard wounded earth cry
bequeath to me
the hoe the hope
ancestral rights
to turn the ground over
to shovel and sift
until history
rewritten resurrected
returns to its rightful owners
a past to claim
yet another stone lifted to
throw against the enemy
making way for new endings
random seeds
spreading over the hillside
wild roses
come by fierce wind and hard rain
unleashed furies
here in this touched wood
a dirge a lamentation
for earth to live again
earth that is all at once a grave
a resting place a bed of new beginnings
avalanche of splendor



small horses ride me
carry my dreams
of prairies and frontiers
where once
the first people roamed
claimed union with the earth
no right to own or possess
no sense of territory
all boundaries
placed by unseen ones
here I will give you thunder
shatter your hearts with rain
let snow soothe you
make your healing water
clear sweet
a sacred spring
where the thirsty
may drink
animals all



listen little sister
angels make their hope here
in these hills
follow me
I will guide you
careful now
no trespass
I will guide you
word for word
mouth for mouth
all the holy ones
embracing us
all our kin
making home here
renegade marooned
lawless fugitives
grace these mountains
we have earth to bind us
the covenant
between us
can never be broken
vows to live and let live"
Afaa Michael WeaverThe Appaloosa"The one horse you gave me
you took back when she went insane
when she began to chew wood
instead of the expensive grain
we bought from the feed store
the grain that had the sweet smell
of molasses and was good for even
us to chew She turned into
an ugly thing with her wild thoughts
and I forgot about the beauty
expected of her when her blanket
filled out and complemented
her chestnut body and the name
the Nez Percé gave her She rotted
and began to stink of promises
gone wrong of gods avenging
their defilement A man who knew
what to do with useless horses
came and took her away in
a wooden trailer she tried to chew
and my tears welled up in huge drops
before they splattered on the ground
as I trembled and realized I would have
to give up her own ghost for her
ghost which she did not have ghost
which she came here beautifully without"
Keith Waldrop"An Apparatus
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""From where I sit I can see other
things a silver porcupine pins
standing upright It is a vanished tale of a
vanished forest at the shore of a vanished ocean

I call the dead as often as I can In the
vaults among mummies—this is pure
memorial I am the girl in whose
eyes the name is written

I feel as if veiled as if soon I
shall get to know something These are people
with encephalitis who cannot go
forward but can go backward and can dance

In this rough draft of my memoirs my brother
comes toward me—frightened skeletal—longing
for marvels I cannot describe it better than by
comparing it to other figures intoxication

Mere reflexes as for instance breathing can become
conscious One of two rivals has his
ornamental tail bit off In dying sounds barely
reaching our ears a melody continues

No end to it—an infinite progression All this
love of a bygone age Watch the track
of a concentrated sunbeam through our lake ice
part of the beam is stopped part goes through

Now the upper surface buckles phantasmagoria of
unchained passion—under which the land
quakes the ocean swells and a myriad-years-
old forest snaps and cracks

Surpassing all forms of experience the wide deep
freshwater lake—on which the city
is built—rises before us Here a modern idea
interposes a new body made from the elements

Then everything is forgotten Sometimes thoughts
are cut off and sometimes they are the
blade which cuts At the present gravel pit electric
lights in the evening cast their magic blue sheen

There’s the sun a crack above those
hills breaking the day If the door open who
comes in If it close what will interrupt
my train

The staircase effect supplies strong evidence
for a subjective map Downhill the sun
trickles unperturbed Here trots a mammoth with
red wool through the black yew forest

The tendency of elements to linger on You say
I dream of what I want but what I
want now is to dream The cold rind
broken the same wind blows

Through a lens of ice the dark
heat of the sun burns wood fires gunpowder melts
lead Perhaps a cloud of musk rises such as
issues from a crocodile in passion

Unless light falls properly upon these
flowers you cannot see them All associations at
this level rain down from above We
talk of word-pictures

We observe vertigo We reach the cleft
by a steep gully or couloir—very dangerous the
path from the heights the glory of
the prospect the insight gained

What I mean is a disturbance in
all the senses at once You will not find
the flower confused Facing a certain
wind there is always danger"
Bruce WeiglApparition of the Exile"There was another life of cool summer mornings the dogwood air and the slag stink so gray like our monsoon which we loved for the rain and cool wind until the rot came into us And I remember the boys we were the evening of our departure our mothers waving through the train’s black pluming exhaust they were not proud in their tears of our leaving so don’t tell me to shut up about the war or I might pull something from my head from my head from my head that you wouldn’t want to see and whoever the people are might be offended

From the green country you reconstruct in your brain from the rubble and stink of your occupation there is no moving out A sweet boy who got drunk and brave on our long ride into the State draws a maze every day on white paper precisely in his room of years as if you could walk into it All day he draws and imagines his platoon will return from the burning river where he sent them sixteen years ago into fire He can’t stop seeing the line of trees explode in white phosphorous blossoms and the liftship sent for them spinning uncontrollably beyond hope into the Citadel wall Only his mother comes these days drying the fruit in her apron or singing the cup of hot tea into his fingers which like barbed wire web the air"
John DonneThe Apparition"When by thy scorn O murdress I am dead
And that thou thinkst thee free
From all solicitation from me
Then shall my ghost come to thy bed
And thee feignd vestal in worse arms shall see
Then thy sick taper will begin to wink
And he whose thou art then being tird before
Will if thou stir or pinch to wake him think
Thou callst for more
And in false sleep will from thee shrink
And then poor aspen wretch neglected thou
Bathd in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lie
A verier ghost than I
What I will say I will not tell thee now
Lest that preserve thee and since my love is spent
Ihad rather thou shouldst painfully repent
Than by my threatnings rest still innocent"
Allan PetersonThe Appeal of Antiques"The intriguing comfort of an imagined past
is entered through objects
the same way we continue the present
but without nostalgia
Parents so long for happiness they say
one life is not enough
and live through their children
But children also live backwards through past candles
crank telephones carriages
the ascendant animals that lived not in imagination
but in Kansas and before
there was an Oklahoma with its spotted sun

In those days a metaphor for Hell was the corn sheller
field corn shriven shooting out cobs
the grindstone razor strop even the ladder of progress
from which Les Westfield slipped
on a mossy rung though his son held the ladder
and fell two stories
one the feudal structure of the family two the harmonic
of almost fatal necessity
as the maple stump entered his hip along with the difficult
remission of breath itself
an antique whose furious elaborations mimicked the rose"
Paul VioliAppeal to the Grammarians"We the naturally hopeful
Need a simple sign
For the myriad ways we’re capsized
We who love precise language
Need a finer way to convey
Disappointment and perplexity
For speechlessness and all its inflections
For up-ended expectations
For every time we’re ambushed
By trivial or stupefying irony
For pure incredulity we need
The inverted exclamation point
For the dropped smile the limp handshake
For whoever has just unwrapped a dumb gift
Or taken the first sip of a flat beer
Or felt love or pond ice
Give way underfoot we deserve it
We need it for the air pocket the scratch shot
The child whose ball doesn’t bounce back
The flat tire at journey’s outset
The odyssey that ends up in Weehawken
But mainly because I need it –here and now
As I sit outside the Caffe Reggio
Staring at my espresso and cannoli
After this middle-aged couple
Came strolling by and he suddenly
Veered and sneezed all over my table
And she said to him “Seethat’s why
I don’t like to eat outside”"
Sarah Louisa FortenAn Appeal to Women"Oh woman woman in thy brightest hour
Of conscious worth of pride of conscious power
Oh nobly dare to act a Christian’s part
That well befits a lovely woman’s heart
Dare to be good as thou canst dare be great
Despise the taunts of envy scorn and hate
Our ‘skins may differ’ but from thee we claim
A sister’s privilege in a sister’s name

We are thy sisters Oh woman woman in thy brightest hour
Of conscious worth of pride of conscious power
Oh nobly dare to act a Christian’s part
That well befits a lovely woman’s heart
Ddare to be good as thou canst dare be great
Despise the taunts of envy scorn and hate
Our ‘skins may differ’ but from thee we claim
A sister’s privilege in a sister’s name

We are thy sisters – God has truly said
That of one blood the nations he has made
Oh christian woman in a christian land
Canst thou unblushing read this great command
Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heart
To draw one throb of pity on thy part
Our ‘skins may differ’ but from thee we claim
A sister’s privilege in a sister’s name

Oh woman – though upon thy fairer brow
The hues of roses and of lilies grow—
These soon must wither in their kindred earth
From whence the fair and dark have equal birth
Let a bright halo o’er thy virtues shed
A lustre that shall live when thou art dead
Let coming ages learn to bless they name
Upon the altar of immortal fame"
Rynn WilliamsAppetite"The merest suggestion of mouth
and I was ravenous—I filled the house
with chocolate chestnuts strudel
blood sausage I bathed in butter

A glimpse of tongue and I was undone
simply a hint of heavy cream
and the wax came off in a greasy slab
there were no cauldrons large enough

I imagined his body drawn in sections
flank ribs and tenderloin I rubbed
the blade to sparks my stove walls
sweated windows dripping

Afterwards the house was a shell
My tongue scorched white
I had to staple my stomach
down to the size of a lichee nut

Thimbleful of broth thimbleful
of gruel the merest suggestion
floods my mouth with memory
so rich I practically drown"
Paulann PetersenAppetite"Pale gold and crumbling with crust
mottled dark almost bronze
pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate
Flecked with the pale paper
of hive their hexagonal cells
leak into the deepening pool
of amber On your lips
against palate tooth and tongue
the viscous sugar squeezes
from its chambers sears sweetness
into your throat until you chew
pulp and wax from a blue city
of bees Between your teeth
is the blown flower and the flowers
seed Passport pages stamped
and turning Deaths officious hum
Both the candle and its anther
of flame Your own yellow hunger
Never say you cant take
this world into your mouth"
Susan Kelly-DeWittApple Blossoms"One evening in winter
when nothing has been enough
when the days are too short

the nights too long
and cheerless the secret
and docile buds of the apple

blossoms begin their quick
ascent to light Night
after interminable night

the sugars pucker and swell
into green slips green
silks And just as you find

yourself at the end
of winter’s long cold
rope the blossoms open

like pink thimbles
and that black dollop
of shine called

bumblebee stumbles in"
Eric EkstrandAppleblossom"When History turns soldiers into battles you turn them into grass
Bashō Sweet is it honorable But for these men who died with grunts
and clangs in their ears for their horses with snapped legs I haven’t got
the art to make them into anything I fold the grass in the shape
of a man very literal very primitive and leave it on
the field and say “Forgive me valorous men for my ineptitude”

Do blue-horned beetles scratch against the starless night sky that lines your head
with the starless night skies of their own domed backs Do centipedes trickle through
Do worms burrow with their snouts with their bodies that are entirely snouts
Snoozer I can only ask you this because now you are dead asleep
Do I ever appear as a nightcrawler whispering in your ear
Are the words “I love you” as soft as the cough of a good luck cricket

Eric EkstrandAppleblossom Leaving Edo"I have a need to ventilate to have my porous body—sockets
and holes—open to the bald-faced wind and have my heatheninner-stuff
tweedled like a reed flute and this piffle floats out But walking on the
open road I know even open roads to be roads at all are ruts

With a careless beanfield on either side off one more time even you
Mr Out-in-the-Woods might as well be stuffed in your hometown bucket
And if these grim beams of trees are truly home Sweet as you say they are
then the timberwolves would reclaim you by singing and that would be all
The Moon would reclaim the timberwolves—not a snarl—soft keepsakes
asleep in the palm of Her hand I would reclaim the Moon by picking
a white silk chrysanthemum and resting it on the branch beside Her
Who would reclaim me and say “Blossom we are not two There is no road
to or from You cannot write a love poem You cannot walk away”

Of apples


Say I were to hold you in my hand like an apple
round and red


And kiss you in bites
on the table or


Under the tree where you droppedtump


And you reached up in cool shadow
on the grass


And bit back crunch

I’d laugh knowing
dreams


Ask like this

Sylvia PlathThe Applicant"First are you our sort of a person
Do you wear
A glass eye false teeth or a crutch
A brace or a hook
Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch

Stitches to show somethings missing No no Then
How can we give you a thing
Stop crying
Open your hand
Empty Empty Here is a hand

To fill it and willing
To bring teacups and roll away headaches
And do whatever you tell it
Will you marry it
It is guaranteed

To thumb shut your eyes at the end
And dissolve of sorrow
We make new stock from the salt
I notice you are stark naked
How about this suit——

Black and stiff but not a bad fit
Will you marry it
It is waterproof shatterproof proof
Against fire and bombs through the roof
Believe me theyll bury you in it

Now your head excuse me is empty
I have the ticket for that
Come here sweetie out of the closet
Well what do you think of that
Naked as paper to start

But in twenty-five years shell be silver
In fifty gold
A living doll everywhere you look
It can sew it can cook
It can talk talk talk

It works there is nothing wrong with it
You have a hole its a poultice
You have an eye its an image
My boy its your last resort
Will you marry it marry it marry it"
Russell LibbyApplied Geometry"Applied geometry
measuring the height
of a pine from
like triangles
Rosa’s shadow stretches
seven paces in
low-slanting light of
late Christmas afternoon
One hundred thirty nine steps
up the hill until the sun is
finally caught at the top of the tree
let’s see
twenty to one
one hundred feet plus a few to adjust
for climbing uphill
and her hands barely reach mine
as we encircle the trunk
almost eleven feet around
Back to the lumber tables
That one tree might make
three thousand feet of boards
if our hearts could stand
the sound of its fall"
Tara BerginAppointment with Jane Austen"Blushing in a manner out of keeping with my age
my graying hair my falling face
I entered Greyfriar’s Inn
I was blushing and out of keeping with my age
In I went making my foolish entrance
folding down my umbrella self-consciously —
aware of the locals at the bar with their gin
and their small talk —
and walked right up to the barmaid
somewhat brazenly I thought One glass of beer
I said to her and she smiling kindly
pulled it I stood and waited
I waited for them all to stop their fond
drunken reminiscences
for them to stop putting forth their opinions
and to turn to me and say — in an accusatory way —
What are you doing here On a Wednesday night
Unaccompanied
With an accent we can’t quite identify

I waited ready

Why am I here I would say
I am here as an imposter an outsider
a reluctant admirer of your lovely daughter Jane —
I am here for my Lecture in the Picturesque
to learn of sidescreens and perspectives
to learn of window tax and syntax — and “ha-has” —
for harmless gambling in the parlor
wearing mittens and handworked collars and a pretty amber cross —
I am here to steal a pistol and a spoon found underground
to rob the peacock feathers streaming from the silly boy’s crown —
I am here I would say for sensation—
For sensation they would say and I would say
YesPainful sensation of restraint or alarm
Oh ye patrons of Greyfriar’s Inn I would exclaim
I am here to meet your high-waisted Jane
to embrace her as my comrade as my brother-in-arms

I stood and waited But the good patrons of Greyfriar’s Inn
they never said a thing just continued talking amongst themselves
quietly reminiscing I paid the barmaid and turned my head
I looked out at the wet I looked out at the southwest rain
and the redbrick houses I watched the famous silhouette
gently swinging back and forth above the gate
I raised the glass to her impassive sideways face
Nothing ventured Nothing gained"
Hannah F GouldApprehension"‘Oh sister he is so swift and tall
Though I want the ride he will spoil it all
For when he sets out he will let me fall
And give me a bump I know
Mamma what was it I heard you say
About the world’s hobbies the other day
How some would get on and gallop away
To end with an overthrow’

‘I said little prattler the world was a race
That many would mount with a smile on the face
And ride to their ruin or fall in disgrace
That him who was deaf to fear
And did not look our for a rein or a guide
His courser might cast on the highway side
In the mud rocks and brambles to end his ride
Perchance with a sight and a tear’

‘Oh sister sister I fear to try
For Brutus’s back is so live and high
It creeps at my touch – and he winks his eye—
I’m sure he is going to jump
Come dear mother tell us some more
About the world’s ride as you did before
Who helped it up – and all how it bore
The fall and got over the bump’"
Catherine BarnettAn Apprehension"Ten below high of zero pm
flashed the alarm panel’s handsome blue touchscreen

Without commotion or fire the afternoon
passed slowly full of promise

then disappointment
Without heartbreak or break-in

For company I had Kafka on my lap
and Qolsys vibrating lightly against the wall


There are all sorts of creatures in the world I read

wretched limited dumb creatures

—Octavio Paz Eagle or Sun
Here I am
posing in a mirror of scratch paper sonnets
sonnets as rare
as a live Aegean rhino

absorbing the cracklings of my craft
its riverine volcanoes
its spectacular lightning peninsulas
emitting plentiful creosote phantoms
from an ironic blizzard of unsettled pleromas

scouring through years of unrecognized pablums
of constant arch-rivalry with extinction
bringing up skulls of intensive discourse
by the claws in one’s mind
which seem to burn with systemic reduction

one then suffers poetic scorching by debris
by inaugural timber which flashes
by friction which flares up amp harries
by unrecognized moltens collapsing in glass
of initial intuitive neglect

as if one’s fangs
were fatally stifled by incipience
by verbal range war didactics
by territorial driftwood
by sudden undemonstrative detractions
awed
by the diverse infernos of Trakl amp Dante

one’s youngish body stands
devoured by reverential print trails
momentarily cancelled
by the loss of blasphemous nerves amp upheaval
stung
by demeaning neutralities
ravaged
by a blank Sumatran solar psychosis
by a tasteless collision of rums in transition
by a conspiracy of obscured fertility by hubris

as one sucks in doubt from a wave of tumbling blister trees
there exists irradiations flecked with a gambled synecdoche
with indeterminate earthenware splinters
taking up
from aboriginal density
a forge of Sumerian verbal signs
cooked with a tendency
towards starfish hypnosis
towards psychic confrontational drainage
conducting one’s frictions in a torrential furnace of osmosis amp ire

yes
apprenticeship
means poetry scrawled in unremitting leper’s mosaic
cringed in smoky interior cubicles
releasing various deleriums
as if pointed under a blackened Oedipal star
with its dark incapable tints
with its musical ruse of unspoken belladonna

poetics
an imaginal flash of Russian chamber lilies
stretching under a blue marsupial sun
like kaleidoscopic tumbleweed
fugaciously transfixed
upon an anomalous totem of glints
upon rainy Buenos Aires transfusions
above the urinal coppers of a flaming polar star rise

of course
kinetic
like magical malachite rivers
flowing from moons
blowing through the / summits of motionless anginas

I’ve looked
for only the tonalities that scorch
which bring to my lips wave after wave
of sensitivity by virulence

yes
a merciless bitterness
brewed by a blue-black tornado of verbs
in a surge of flashing scorpion chatter
in a dessicated storm of inferential parallels amp voltage
like a scattered igneous wind
co-terminus with the bleeding hiatus amp the resumption of breath

resolved by flash point edicts
by consumptive stellar limes
by curvature in tense proto-Bretonian fatigue

mixing magnets
juggling centripetal anti-podes amp infinities
cracking the smoke of pure rupestral magentas

yes
hatcheries
floating through acetylene corruption of practiced mental restraint
to splendiferous vistas mingled with inspirational roulette
its mysteriums
always leaping like a grainy rash of scorching tarantellas
or leaking moon spun alloestrophas
as if speaking
in irregular glossological green Dutch

a frenetic seminar on febricity
a reitteration of hendecasyllabic agitation amp stinging
a ferocious vacillation
explosive as random “aggregational” nodes
mimed by a black consonantal dissection
its maximal priority
forked at “hypotactic inclusion”
with isochronous internal procedure
with ratios
with phonic penetralia by distortion
primed by anomalous “nuclear accent”
by a cadence composing syllables amp compounds

Harry CliftonThe Approaches"A childless futureless road
And then nothing   Is that it
Or start believing in a God
Beyond the temporal limit

Of westering skies wide melancholy
Uncut fields and paced-out walls
As we drive towards it slowly
The house that has us both in thrall

They are gone now the hours of light
It took to get here Might-have-beens
Lost wanderyears But thats alright—
We are trading it in the seen

For the experienced the car keys
For the end of the journey
When distances have lost their power
And the heart beats slower

In tomorrows cold a coming weather
One degree north of yesterday
High latitudes—as they say
There is nothing up here

But wind and silence passing clouds
Light diminished half a tone
A dish left out all night for the gods
By morning turned to stone

So take a right go down two gears
And stay in second where the church is
And the pig farm Only the approaches
Are terrible only the years

The getting here which takes forever
A boy in tears a barren crone
On a bicycle a man alone—
Theyre waving   Its now or never

For the final self I assume—
For the shape of the house
On the skyline the release
Into childhood and the coming home"
W S GrahamApproaches to How They Behave"

What does it matter if the words
I choose in the order I choose them in
Go out into a silence I know
Nothing about there to be let
In and entertained and charmed
Out of their master’s orders And yet
I would like to see where they go
And how without me they behave




Speaking is difficult and one tries
To be exact and yet not to
Exact the prime intention to death
On the other hand the appearance of things
Must not be made to mean another
Thing It is a kind of triumph
To see them and to put them down
As what they are The inadequacy
Of the living animal language drives
Us all to metaphor and an attempt
To organize the spaces we think
We have made occur between the words




The bad word and the bad word and
The word which glamours me with some
Quick face it pulls to make me let
It leave me to go across
In roughly your direction hates
To go out maybe so completely
On another silence not its own




Before I know it they are out
Afloat in the head which freezes them
Then I suppose I take the best
Away and leave the others arranged
Like floating bergs to sink a convoy




One word says to its mate O
I do not think we go together
Are we doing any good here
Why do we find ourselves put down
The mate pleased to be spoken to
Looks up from the line below
And says well that doubtful god
Who has us here is far from sure
How we on our own tickle the chin
Of the prince or the dame that lets us in




The dark companion is a star
Very present like a dark poem
Far and unreadable just out
At the edge of this poem floating
It is not more or less a dark
Companion poem to the poem




Language is expensive if
We want to strut busked out
Showing our best on silence
Good Morning That is a bonny doing
Of verbs you wear with the celandine
Catching the same sun as mine
You wear your dress like a prince but
A country’s prince beyond my ken
Through the chinks in your lyric coat
My ear catches a royal glimpse
Of fuzzed flesh unworded body
Was there something you wanted to say
I myself dress up in what I can
Afford on the broadway Underneath
My overcoat of the time’s slang
I am fashionable enough wearing
The grave-clothes of my generous masters




And what are you supposed to say
I asked a new word but it kept mum
I had secretly admired always
What I thought it was here for
But I was wrong when I looked it up
Between the painted boards It said
Something it was never very likely
I could fit in to a poem in my life




The good word said I am not pressed
For time I have all the foxglove day
And all my user’s days to give
You my attention Shines the red
Fox in the digitalis grove
Choose me choose me Guess which
Word I am here calling myself
The best If you can’t fit me in
To lying down here among the fox
Glove towers of the moment say
I am yours the more you use me Tomorrow
Same place same time give me a ring




Backwards the poem’s just as good
We human angels as we read
Read back as we gobble the words up
Allowing the poem to represent
A recognizable landscape
Sprouting green up or letting green
With all its weight of love hang
To gravity’s sweet affection
Arse-versa it is the same object
Even although the last word seems
To have sung first or the breakfast lark
Sings up from the bottom of the sea




The poem is not a string of knots
Tied for a meaning of another time
And county unreadable found
By chance The poem is not a henge
Or Easter Island emerged Longnose
Or a tally used by early unknown
Peoples The words we breathe and puff
Are our utensils down the dream
Into the manhole Replace the cover




The words are mine The thoughts are all
Yours as they occur behind
The bat of your vast unseen eyes
These words are as you see them put
Down on the dead-still page They have
No ability above their station
Their station on silence is exact
What you do with them is nobody’s business




Running across the language lightly
This morning in the hangingover
Whistling light from the window I
Was tripped and caught into the whole
Formal scheme which Art is
I had only meant to enjoy
Dallying between the imaginary
And imaginary’s opposite
With a thought or two up my sleeve




Is the word Yes Yes But I hear
A sound without words from another
Person I can’t see at my elbow
A sigh to be proud of You Me




Having to construct the silence first
To speak out on I realize
The silence even itself floats
At my ear-side with a character
I have not met before Hello
Hello I shout but that silence
Floats steady will not be marked
By an off-hand shout For some reason
It refuses to be broken now
By what I thought was worth saying
If I wait a while if I look out
At the heavy greedy rooks on the wall
It will disperse Now I construct
A new silence I hope to break"
C D WrightApproximately Forever"She was changing on the inside
it was true what had been written

The new syntax of love
both sucked and burned

The secret clung around them
She took in the smell

Walking down a road to nowhere
every sound was relevant

The sun fell behind them now
he seemed strangely moved

She would take her clothes off
for the camera

she said in plain english
but she wasn’t holding that snake"

trotting along Riverside Drive
in the early spring afternoon
sniffing this way and that

Richard Katrovas"April  ""It is snowing in southwest Michigan
Such weather is unusual so late
The trees are squirting buds that advocate
For green profusions that yesterday began
To grunt and poke and strain toward full-blown spring
Now fleeced the trees are January stark
Though clocks sprung forward hedge against the dark
We hear the arias our miseries sing
When darkness is a slave to all that white
If global warming is the fangs of doom
I see its poison wafting from this room
The future will be mottled if not bright
Perhaps I’ll die before the killing trend
I hear my children’s voices on this wind"

APRIL FOOL"
Heidi MordhorstApril Gale"Oh how the wind howls
howls the blossoms from the boughs

Oh how the boughs bend
bend and willow to the ground

Oh how the ground wells
wells with blossoms blown to hills

Oh how the hills sound
sound a whisper pink and loud"
W D SnodgrassApril Inventory"The green catalpa tree has turned
All white the cherry blooms once more
In one whole year I haven’t learned
A blessed thing they pay you for
The blossoms snow down in my hair
The trees and I will soon be bare

The trees have more than I to spare
The sleek expensive girls I teach
Younger and pinker every year
Bloom gradually out of reach
The pear tree lets its petals drop
Like dandruff on a tabletop

The girls have grown so young by now
I have to nudge myself to stare
This year they smile and mind me how
My teeth are falling with my hair
In thirty years I may not get
Younger shrewder or out of debt

The tenth time just a year ago
I made myself a little list
Of all the things I’d ought to know
Then told my parents analyst
And everyone who’s trusted me
I’d be substantial presently

I haven’t read one book about
A book or memorized one plot
Or found a mind I did not doubt
I learned one date And then forgot
And one by one the solid scholars
Get the degrees the jobs the dollars

And smile above their starchy collars
I taught my classes Whitehead’s notions
One lovely girl a song of Mahler’s
Lacking a source-book or promotions
I showed one child the colors of
A luna moth and how to love

I taught myself to name my name
To bark back loosen love and crying
To ease my woman so she came
To ease an old man who was dying
I have not learned how often I
Can win can love but choose to die

I have not learned there is a lie
Love shall be blonder slimmer younger
That my equivocating eye
Loves only by my body’s hunger
That I have forces true to feel
Or that the lovely world is real

While scholars speak authority
And wear their ulcers on their sleeves
My eyes in spectacles shall see
These trees procure and spend their leaves
There is a value underneath
The gold and silver in my teeth

Though trees turn bare and girls turn wives
We shall afford our costly seasons
There is a gentleness survives
That will outspeak and has its reasons
There is a loveliness exists
Preserves us not for specialists"
Marilyn SingerApril Is a Dogs Dream"april is a dogs dream

what spring is all about"
Ernest DowsonApril Love﻿"We have walked in Loves land a little way
We have learnt his lesson a little while
And shall we not part at the end of day
With a sigh a smile
A little while in the shine of the sun
We were twined together joined lips forgot
How the shadows fall when the day is done
And when Love is not
We have made no vows--there will none be broke
Our love was free as the wind on the hill
There was no word said we need wish unspoke
We have wrought no ill
So shall we not part at the end of day
Who have loved and lingered a little while
Join lips for the last time go our way
With a sigh a smile
"
Arthur SymonsApril Midnight﻿"Side by side through the streets at midnight
Roaming together
Through the tumultuous night of London
In the miraculous April weather

Roaming together under the gaslight
Day’s work over
How the Spring calls to us here in the city
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover

Cool to the wind blows fresh in our faces
Cleansing entrancing
After the heat and the fumes and the footlights
Where you dance and I watch your dancing

Good it is to be here together
Good to be roaming
Even in London even at midnight
Lover-like in a lover’s gloaming

You the dancer and I the dreamer
Children together
Wandering lost in the night of London
In the miraculous April weather

Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops
Let the rain sing you a lullaby

And I love the rain"

It is cold enough for rain
to coagulate and fall in heavy drops
Tonight a skin of ice will grow
over the bones of the smallest bush

making it droop like the wrist
of someone carrying a heavy suitcase This moving on
from season to season is exhausting
and violent the break from the Berlin Wall

of winter especially Like a frostbitten
hand coming to life I color
first with warmth
then with pain Thawing letting

the great powers go
their own way in rivers and in flesh
frightens me as this day
warns me of an icy night


Each year I am astonished
at the havoc wrought
on other lives fathers
made tiny by cancer

a mother swollen around
a bad heart ""brought on by aggravation""
To suffer is to do something new
yet always the same—

a change of life
from the sexual dread Some women
wish they were men some men
wish they were dead still

there is coin in suffering   
It makes us rich
as Croesus in his golden tears
and we are rarely hated for it

This coin I store in a purse
made of my mothers
milk and flesh which God says I must not mix
I use it instead to seek pleasure


Walking around with this thing in me
all day this loving cup
full of jelly waiting for you
to come home—seven oclock

eight oclock eight-thirty   
What could be more important
than love I cant imagine you can
Not a good day not about to get better


The bird comes complete
with heart liver and neck-bone
wrapped chastely in white paper
Still half-frozen

the legs are hard to separate
Inside wax paper sticks to the ribs
I reach like a vet delivering pigs
or a boy finger-fucking a virgin


Air the same sweet
temperature inside the house
as outside the house
Stepping up from the cellar

with an armful of sheets
I listen for the dirge of flies
under the chittering birds
both painfully loud There is a stridency

thats stubborn in a life
grown by inches the fat
little fingers of buds bursting
ugly ducklings the slow war

of day against night
As I pin the swelling sheets
with clothespins damp and too
narrow at the mouth I wonder how

flies know to come out
to feed the birds and feast themselves
on the new stillborn this stubborn
great chain of being"
Kim AddonizioAquarium"The fish are drifting calmly in their tank
between the green reeds lit by a white glow
that passes for the sun Blindly the blank
glass that holds them in displays their slow
progress from end to end familiar rocks
set into the gravel murmuring rows
of filters a universe the flying fox
and glass cats Congo tetras bristle-nose
pleocostemus all take for granted Yet
the platys gold and red persist in leaping
occasionally as if they cant quite let
alone a possibility—of wings
maybe once they reach the air They die
on the rug We find them there eyes open in surprise"
Liz Ahl"Aquarium February""When ice outside makes daggers of the grass
I come to where the tides of life still flow
The water here still moves behind the glass

In here the seasons never seem to pass—
the sullen shark and rays still come and go
Outside the ice makes daggers of the grass

and coats the roads The meditative bass
wont puzzle how the blustery blizzards blow
The water here still moves Behind the glass

rose-tinted corals house a teeming mass
of busy neon creatures who dont know
""outside"" The ice makes daggers of the grass

and oily puddles into mirrors Gas
freezes in its lines my car wont go
but water here still moves behind the glass

No piles of valentines no heart held fast—
just sea stars under lights kept soft and low
Outside the ice makes daggers of the grass
in here the water moves behind the glass"

that mimic river beds Before
and breathes the anxious air in traffic
filled with tension left from wooded crossroads in attack
He shops the windows happy
where the stalking once was good
and his kitchen floor is built on bones
of venison once gently roasted

""Its a good place for a party"" he concurs
to friends now dressed in jeans

The ground was already beaten smooth
and festive by the joy of ancient dances

He feels the warmth
and doesnt know his soul is filled
with the spirit of coyotes past"
Marilyn NelsonArachis Hypogaea"Great Creator why
did you make the peanut
—GWC
Arachis Hypogaea may have been
smuggled to North America by slaves
who hid seeds of survival in their hair
Despite your nakedness the chains the stench
if white men did not eat you you might come
to a cruel land where tended by moonlight
and exhaustion your seed might grow to be
your childrens manna in the wilderness

Arachis Hypogaea or goober
an annual preferring warmth and sun
is an attractive plant resembling clover
It bears flowers of two distinct genders
the staminate or “male” yellow pretty
and the inconspicuous pistillate “female”
When fertilized the pistillate turns down
and corkscrews six inches into the ground

Each corkscrew called a “peg” grows one to four
peanuts in the soil near the mother plant
each shell two of her shots at infinity
From the laboratory of a slave emerged
a varied balanced diet for the poor
stock foods ink paints cosmetics medicines 
Promise and purpose the Ancestors dream
“The Peanut Man” we say and laugh at him"

and shouting of Easter Sunday
it was the ball of the princess
it was Pharoah’s body
sleeping in its golden case
At the foot of the picket fence
in grass lank with the morning rain
it was a Sunday school prize
silver for second place gold
for the triumphant little dome
of Ararat and my sister
took me by the hand and led me
out onto the wide wet lawn
and showed me to bend into the thick nests
of grass into the darkest green
Later I had to give it back
in exchange for a prize
though I would rather have kept the egg
What might have coiled inside it
Crocuses tight on their clock-springs
a bird who’d sing himself into an angel
in the highest reaches of the garden
the morning’s flaming arrow
Any small thing can save you
Because the golden egg gleamed
in my basket once though my childhood
became an immense sheet of darkening water
I was Noah and I was his ark
and there were two of every animal inside me"

and the cardboard cathedral as if trapped in the dream
twenty years early the whole a furious search
as if for a reason Still its sex that spoils it isnt it

Jackson Square was the smallest sufficient landscape

falls ever backward Some of us lived there though
What shall we say who have knowledge
carried to the heart"
James LongenbachArcadia"

Just as there were reeds along the riverbank
Just as there were clouds
Above my head my lute was lying beside me on the grass

I placed the little finger of my right hand on the soundboard
Just below the strings
Not the tip of the finger the side

I curled the palm of my right hand towards me
Covering the strings so that I played
The bass note with the thumb
The next with the index
And the top note with the third

The sun retreated the night turned cold
Rain began to fall softly at first
Though surely rain had fallen here before as rain falls everywhere

With my left hand I positioned my thumb and index finger
Opposite each other bearing no weight
As if the neck of the lute were not there



At this they all laughed

Then the Count began afresh My lords he said I am not pleased with the young man if he is not also a musician and if besides his cunning upon the book he have not skill in like manner on sundry instruments There is no ease of labor more honest and more praiseworthy especially at court where many things are taken in hand to please women whose tender breasts are soon pierced with melody

Then the Lord Gasper I believe music he said together with other vanities is mete for women also for them that have the likeness of men but not for them that be men indeed who ought not with such delicacies womanize their minds and so bring themselves to dread death

— The First Booke of the Courtyer of Count Baldessar Castilio



For many years I lived apart in happy oblivion
In retrospect I understand I’d been a child
Though lacking comparisons I couldn’t have said so

I learned things things no child left to himself could possiblyknow
My head which had been empty now was full

My head would grow larger
How could it not

At night standing in the shower I closed my eyes
The water trickled down my forehead
To my nose from my nose to my lips my chin then disappeared

But some of what stayed in my head
Should not have been there



Listen said the reeds along the riverbank the nymphs
Are weeping for Daphnis
His mother embraces his body railing against the stars

Nobody drives his cattle to the cool stream no one could drink
The mountains echo with the beasts of the desert

Daphnis it was you who yoked them to the chariot
Who led us in the dance weaving
Together vine leaves with reeds

The vine exceeds the tree on which it climbs
The grape exceeds the vine
The calf the herd the corn the field

Now where we planted barley thistles grow
Where once were violets hyacinths — nothing but weeds

Scatter the ground with flowers shepherds
Set out two bowls
One of milk and one of oil
Then carve these lines from Virgil on his tomb
I was Daphnis in these woodsThe stars knew my nameBeautiful the flock more beautiful the shepherd"

any city but itself and in its sadness it gives
away a great door in the air Well
a city cannot except for Paris who puts
on a hat styled with pigeon wings and walks
through the streets of another city and will not
even see the sights too full she is of the sights
already And within her walk her women
and the women of Paris looking like
they just walked through an Arch

Or am I mixing it up I think I am
with another famous female statue Born
in its shadow and shook-foil hot the facts
slid off me also I and the Arch we burned
to the touch “Don’t touch that Arch a boy
we know got third-degree burns from touch-
ing that Arch” says my mother sitting
for her statue She is metal on a hilltop and
so sad she isn’t a Cross She was long ago
given to us by Ireland What an underhand
gift for an elsewhere to give a door
that reminds you you can leave it She raises
her arm to brush my hair Oh no female
armpit lovelier than the armpit of the Arch"
Hester KnibbeThe Archaeologist"In one who doesn’t speak the story petrifies
gets stumbled over causes hurt Then

says the man who should know about the past then
is a word you need to learn now Then

in so many words pointing to the ornate

temple corridor an altar
conjured at its vanishing point"

Gina Franco"Archaeopteryx an Elegy""As soon as possible I will confront the wren’s
doings rinse the white streaks from the porch bricks
drawing lizards from their shade the immediate
smell of water too much for all of us
But first is lunch The remains we’ll scatter over
the driveway away from the bricks Wrens come
crusts from our dishes make drama Then history

What is possible in memory is disingenuous
Limestone impressed with the archaic smile
of bone and reptilian wrists wishbones and feathers
describes It cups the transitional form
naturally selecting one’s best side There was
the time you forgot your legs no longer
could recall how to stand—then rose up straight and sang

You’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Probably I’ve been thinking of that since August
The indelible wrens grate like shovels
outside—exhumed one voice rises from wilderness
echoes
settles rests
—then another and
between them the keep of an unerring quiet"
Louise GlückArchaic Fragment"I was trying to love matter
I taped a sign over the mirror
You cannot hate matter and love form


It was a beautiful day though cold
This was for me an extravagantly emotional gesture

your poem
tried but could not

I taped a sign over the first sign
Cry

weep

thrash yourself

rend your garments

List of things to love
dirt food shells human hair

 said
tasteless excess Then I

rent the signs

Vicki HearneThe Archer"The sudden thuck of landing
The arrow made in the mark
Of the center lifted and

Loosened his skin And so he
Stood hearing it like many
Thrusting breaths driven to ground

He abandoned the long light
Flight of arrows and the slow
Parabolas bows dream of

For the swifter song beyond
Flesh Song of moments The earth
Turned its molten balance

He stood hearing it again
The precise shudder the arrow
Sought and returned to flaming"
Edgar Lee MastersArchibald Higbie"I loathed you Spoon River I tried to rise above you

I was ashamed of you I despised you

As the place of my nativity

And there in Rome among the artists

Speaking Italian speaking French

I seemed to myself at times to be free

Of every trace of my origin

I seemed to be reaching the heights of art

And to breathe the air that the masters breathed

And to see the world with their eyes

But still they’d pass my work and say

""What are you driving at my friend

Sometimes the face looks like Apollo’s

At others it has a trace of Lincoln’s""

There was no culture you know in Spoon River

And I burned with shame and held my peace

And what could I do all covered over

And weighted down with western soil

Except aspire and pray for another

Birth in the world with all of Spoon River

Rooted out of my soul"
Alexandria PearyThe Architecture of a Love Poem"Loves balustrade loves balcony
a few iron words that can be seen anywhere still
in grocery lists in laundry hung between two objects
an e-mail in an apology in a thought about the weather
these rusty words these rusting gates
before a breath Standing in the cold morning
on a cold blue stairs with a curlicue of coffee
you look at the word Love written on the
side of the Pharmacy in cherry-vanilla flavored cursive
because this is where a love poem once stood
what I am saying right now is secretly built over
a love poem the fossils of a cupola
pink buildings with red hyphens and dashes
and three red dots You second person pink
with shutters you could open with a fingernail
like in an advent calendar to see sticker scenes
of apartments inside a radiator a bare arm
two cups by themselves on a table
The mind of the attic still persists up there
meditative water
and the chairs talking quietly to one another
Its now pink rubble rhyming bricks and an illicit balcony
the heart had such a fancy elevator
that it started to look like a bird cage
and once in a lemon-scented fog
near springtime-fresh trees I heard two people say
""Yellow kiss-shaped flowers telephone flowers
are falling from my mouth now""
Now its a set of blue and white checkered apartment buildings
math problems that are eight stories high
a long division jutting as pollution into the sky
laundry cooking spills gasoline shirts
commas theories or arguments of boyfriends amp girlfriends
boyfriends amp boyfriends girlfriends amp girlfriends
all hanging out of the window that you opened"
Joshua Clover"“An Archive of Confessions A Genealogy of Confessions”""Now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark
City under the strict surveillance of quotation marks

The citizens with their cockades and free will drift off
From the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love

In the far suburbs crenellated of Cartesian yards and gin
The tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in

Across the bluing evening It’s the hour things get
To be excellently pointless like describing the alphabet

Yikes It’s fine to be here with you watching the great events
Without taking part clinking our ice as they advance

Yet remain distant Like the baker always about to understand
Idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of Napoleon

In a baker’s life always interrupted by the familiar notes
Of a childish song “no more sleepy dreaming” we float

Casually on the surface of the day staring at the bottom
Jotting in our daybooks how beautiful the armies of autumn"
Percy sshe ShelleyArchys Song from Charles I A Widow Bird Sate Mourning"Heigho the lark and the owl
One flies the morning and one lulls the night
Only the nightingale poor fond soul
Sings like the fool through darkness and light

""A widow bird sate mourning for her love
Upon a wintry bough
The frozen wind crept on above
The freezing stream below

""There was no leaf upon the forest bare
No flower upon the ground
And little motion in the air
Except the mill-wheels sound"""

Aimee NezhukumatathilAre All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real"If by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck
in your heel the wetness of a finished lollipop stick
the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse—
then Yes every last page is true every nuance
bit and biteWait I have made them up—all of them—
and when I say I am married it means I married
all of them a whole neighborhood of past loves
Can you imagine the number of bouquets how many
slices of cake Even now my husbands plan a great meal
for us—one chops up some parsley one stirs a bubbling pot
on the stove One changes the baby and one sleeps
in a fat chair One flips through the newspaper another
whistles while he shaves in the shower and every single
one of them wonders what time I am coming home"
Alice NotleyAre Loyal"Okay part of it’s
here See it

I want you to see my brother dead smiling
in a red short-sleeved shirt
You look so much better

I got through
How does time work for you

I can see where — when — I felt bad
Goes past I’m not in it any more
But this change hasn’t happened in time — a kind of
before and after but nocontinuum
You look brilliant I
never let you down — he says — did I
It wasn’t possible     Why not
Sisters and brothers are loyal

we are the primal particles
I saw how we connected to make a shape
in the eyes of the beholder who chose it But we
are not that What I see is free to change its outline
My story the shadow of one Why did I
shrink into a story It’s easier to talk
as a person but why I guess we decided to talking
Coyote throws the stars up into the sky"
Richard JonesAre there poems you wont publish"Even CP Cavafy–
cynical ascetic
unknown in his day–
printed at his own expense
poems no one would publish
poems intimate personal
to share with readers
he called friends

But I have hundreds of poems
hidden away in a box
Even when I know
Cavafy once wrapped verse
with black and gold ribbons
to give away as a gift"
Samuel DanielAre They Shadows"Are they shadows that we see
And can shadows pleasure give
Pleasures only shadows be
Cast by bodies we conceive
And are made the things we deem
In those figures which they seem

But these pleasures vanish fast
Which by shadows are expressed
Pleasures are not if they last
In their passing is their best
Glory is most bright and gay
In a flash and so away

Feed apace then greedy eyes
On the wonder you behold
Take it sudden as it flies
Though you take it not to hold
When your eyes have done their part
Thought must length it in the heart"
Dobby GibsonAre We There Yet"You only have to make her one grilled cheese
in the suffocating heat of summer
while still wearing your wet swim trunks
to know what it’s like to be in love
And you only have to sit once
for a haircut in the air conditioning
with the lovely stylist to forget all about it
and to forget that anything in the universe
ever existed prior to the small pink sweater
now brushing softly against your neck
In this world every birth is premature
How else to explain all of this silence
all of this screaming
all of those Christmas card letters
about how well the kids are doing in school
We’re all struggling to say the same old things
in new and different ways
And so we must praise the new and different ways
I don’t like Christmas
I miss you that much
For I too have heard the screaming
and I too have tried to let it pass
and still I’ve been up half the night
as if I were half this old
and like you I hate this kind of poetry
just as much as my life depends upon it
They’re giving away tiny phones for free these days
but they’ve only made
a decent conversation more precious
One medicine stops the swelling
another medicine stops the first medicine
Just like you I entered this world
mad and kicking and without you
it’s precisely how I intend to go"

Essa RanapiriAre You Seeing Your Own Death and Selling It to Me"you lie on your back
arms close to your sides
the body as a card run through the slit of the EFTPOS machine
and stopped
rubbed off on a coin or two a set of eyes lingering underneath
when you move them you can feel the iris brush against the profile of Queen Elizabeth
or a native bird
it costs actual material money to change these symbols
it costs actual material money to make actual material money valid and invalid
what does a banker fall asleep thinking about
hand wrapped around notes stuffed between the mattress and the bed frame
you’re lying next to that body and feel bad
for thinking about ways to kill yourself and/or him
who voted for this system of profit
no one voted on the voting system
you think about dragging his sleeping body to the balcony
he sleeps like the dead
so fat chance of him waking
throw him from the second floor
but you second-guess yourself
not because you don’t think you could do it
you’re not sure the drop would do it
you take the gold from your lids
place it on the bedside table"
Walt Whitman"""Are you the new person drawn toward me""""Are you the new person drawn toward me
To begin with take warning I am surely far different from what you suppose
Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal
Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover
Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy’d satisfaction
Do you think I am trusty and faithful
Do you see no further than this façade this smooth and tolerant manner of me
Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man
Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya illusion"
Carol FrostArgonauts Vow"Pushed prow southerly into the golden wind

hurt the eyes gold pelted water so looked less far away

to its source in cedar and when sunlight embers

squatting over his shapeless shadow in the shadow of the Parthenon —

shadow form from wood “in the light of”

organized ruckus in his medium rare town which
God knows nobody there “thought” would
survive a golden paradigm for thousands of
Apollonian twirls Who knows what they thought
of what they thought It must’ve
been intensely local that
the universe crept into
valley code was just
brain refreshment Dirt was all
around Some bright body shambled

shook his bald Why is the sky
blues into registration virgin

beat of a million bovine feet
upon the tender luxury
sidewinding from the brain
So he thought “Thought” Why not
Natural in a sense Never before
had such perfect innocence been explored
like new property
Well such a new idea as “idea”
looks pretty good till you can check out how it settles into the ground
Blood’s biodegradable but logos
piled up like a plastic eyesore fore-
shadowed a bloodless dry reign

its pustulations of post- amp pre- professing
everything subjugating us all in the tick-tech
burned-out success of a nob objectivity
turning babble to a soapy

Aw c’mon the alchemy that pilfers
from golden sundance volumes of German silver
sucks tongue of essence —
ah yes essence with its can-do incandescence
like “Lovelight’s our leverage to spring some uptight average
from alla this quotidian sewage
ampitalicize it boot it through the uprights

So anyway this guy imagined up God outa the play-dough

says — “In the winter the house is all shadow”
But the long hot summer of essentialism
“was” a system of no resistance —
amp all the psychological shit that makes a

difficult to invent like anything you can’t

amp dots the shadow of dot
amp hand is the shadow of and
however the shadow of breath
amp season the shadow of winter

amp ring’s shadow is “orange”
amp window shadow of the shadow

—after all Empedocles
amp Anaximander had
illuminated life as shadows of whatever up from sea-slime
dissolving to the harmony of a sphere

Logos in the light is only haze
a honey-head that the shape
be kept as “beautiful”

amp the shadow structure
is the real — it’s not being looked at
nor still distorted by leftover rays in the shadowee
nor in such relation to light as shadowing implies
once you’ve taken in the light
you’re artificially simple for good — bedazzled
Chiaroscuro conjures up dichotomy — Step 
then as it loses all idea to total presence
becomes invisible enough
amp we’re home
Lightning strikes — OK
Half-known moves around the kitchen
The cereal box is food for thought
Is it easier to be right when you’re already wrong
Hmm cool today better pull on my dark-blue paradigm

from the neighbor’s chimney

Thomas P LynchArgyle on Knocknagaroon"Because he barely heard the voice of God
above the hum of other choristers—
batwing and bird-whistle gathering thunder

because he could not readily discern
the plan Whoever Is In Charge Here has
he wondered about those who claimed to have
blessed assurances or certainty
a One and Only Way and Truth and Life
as if Whatever Breathes in Everything
mightn’t speak in every wondrous tongue
as if of all creations only one
made any sense It made no sense to him
Hunger he understood touch desire
He knew the tenderness humans could do
no less brutalitiesHe knew the cold
morning the broad meadow the gold sunset
One evening on the hill of Knocknagaroon

on the other the narrowing headlands
of the peninsula out behind him
the broad green palm of Moveen before him
it seemed he occupied the hand of God
open upturned outstretched uplifting him"
David BarberAria"What if   it were possible to vanquish
All this shame with a wash of   varnish
Instead of wishing the stain would vanish

What if   you gave it a glossy finish
What if   there were a way to burnish
All this foolishness all the anguish

What if   you gave yourself   leave to ravish
All these ravages with famished relish
What if   this were your way to flourish

What if   the self   you love to punish —
Knavish peevish wolfish sheepish —
Were all slicked up in something lavish

Why so squeamish Why make a fetish
Out of everything you must relinquish
Why not embellish what you can’t abolish

What would be left if   you couldn’t brandish
All the slavishness you’ve failed to banish
What would you be without this gibberish

What if   the true worth of the varnish
Were to replenish your resolve to vanquish
Every vain wish before you vanish"
Sylvia PlathAriel"Stasis in darkness
Then the substanceless blue
Pour of tor and distances

God’s lioness
How one we grow
Pivot of heels and knees—The furrow

Splits and passes sister to
The brown arc
Of the neck I cannot catch

Nigger-eye
Berries cast dark
Hooks—

Black sweet blood mouthfuls
Shadows
Something else

Hauls me through air—
Thighs hair
Flakes from my heels

White
Godiva I unpeel—
Dead hands dead stringencies

And now I
Foam to wheat a glitter of seas
The child’s cry

Melts in the wall
And I
Am the arrow

The dew that flies
Suicidal at one with the drive
Into the red

Eye the cauldron of morning"
Li-Young Lee"Arise Go Down""It wasn’t the bright hems of the Lord’s skirts
that brushed my face and I opened my eyes
to see from a cleft in rock His backside

it’s a wasp perched on my left cheek I keep
my eyes closed and stand perfectly still
in the garden till it leaves me alone

not to contemplate how this century
ends and the next begins with no one
I know having seen God but to wonder

why I get through most days unscathed though I
live in a time when it might be otherwise
and I grow more fatherless each day

For years now I have come to conclusions
without my father’s help discovering
on my own what I know what I don’t know

and seeing how one cancels the other
Ive become a scholar of cancellations
Here I stand among my father’s roses

and see that what punctures outnumbers what
consoles the cruel and the tender never
make peace though one climbs though one descends

petal by petal to the hidden ground
no one owns I see that which is taken
away by violence or persuasion

The rose announces on earth the kingdom
of gravity A bird cancels it
My eyelids cancel the bird Anything

might cancel my eyes distance time war
My father saidNever take your both eyes
off of the world"
Sandra SimondsThe Aristocracy"I like when the form is kind of stuck-up
even though I’ve got a Southern accent and my place
looks like a graduate student’s  I enjoy
high art but realism swamps me
 The material world swamps me
 I came to understand
the forms of realism
the aesthetic phenomenon
 You take a random person
from daily life
 You take their dependence
on their historical circumstances
 You make them
the subject
 You see they operate
the modern
Things happen  minutes hours days
The order of life
coming from life itself
Back to life /
Back to reality like Soul II Soul
It is sublime
and grotesque
 They make rich forms
Something steady
Less manic
Something real
like a bell
inside the Golden Seahorse Gift Shop

Don’t take me
on that ride
I don’t want
to go down

 To what degree
are the subjects
taken seriously
They naturally swim
beneath the icy sheets
and find breathing holes
They may remember
their arctic homes
They are one of the park’s
most sociable creatures I said
enter the water with them
Graceful imitation of strange
palms and seaflowers A seaflower
of a thousand colors aquarium
pigmented It is my violent
passion for seaflowers Molly
I want the entire
underwater palace
built of roaring seaflowers
Beluga Beluga Wither and mow
The child’s song

Emerald kayak
and the femme fatale
who sleeps in it Victorian
long frothy hair
and the death drive
flesh like the statement “I lost a friend
in the sea garden”
The notes staccato vortex
paradisiacal gold bell in a coffin
just in case I wake up And the way
darkness tunnels
inside a car on its way
to its pinpoint destination
No one tells you
the moon’s going
to end up like this
No one So you just move towards it
That’s all the moon
ever was Ding Ding"
Billy Collins"Aristotle
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""This is the beginning
Almost anything can happen
This is where you find
the creation of light a fish wriggling onto land
the first word of Paradise Lost on an empty page
Think of an egg the letter A
a woman ironing on a bare stage
as the heavy curtain rises
This is the very beginning
The first-person narrator introduces himself
tells us about his lineage
The mezzo-soprano stands in the wings
Here the climbers are studying a map
or pulling on their long woolen socks
This is early on years before the Ark dawn
The profile of an animal is being smeared
on the wall of a cave
and you have not yet learned to crawl
This is the opening the gambit
a pawn moving forward an inch
This is your first night with her
your first night without her
This is the first part
where the wheels begin to turn
where the elevator begins its ascent
before the doors lurch apart

This is the middle
Things have had time to get complicated
messy really Nothing is simple anymore
Cities have sprouted up along the rivers
teeming with people at cross-purposes—
a million schemes a million wild looks
Disappointment unshoulders his knapsack
here and pitches his ragged tent
This is the sticky part where the plot congeals
where the action suddenly reverses
or swerves off in an outrageous direction
Here the narrator devotes a long paragraph
to why Miriam does not want Edwards child
Someone hides a letter under a pillow
Here the aria rises to a pitch
a song of betrayal salted with revenge
And the climbing party is stuck on a ledge
halfway up the mountain
This is the bridge the painful modulation
This is the thick of things
So much is crowded into the middle—
the guitars of Spain piles of ripe avocados
Russian uniforms noisy parties
lakeside kisses arguments heard through a wall—
too much to name too much to think about

And this is the end
the car running out of road
the river losing its name in an ocean
the long nose of the photographed horse
touching the white electronic line
This is the colophon the last elephant in the parade
the empty wheelchair
and pigeons floating down in the evening
Here the stage is littered with bodies
the narrator leads the characters to their cells
and the climbers are in their graves
It is me hitting the period
and you closing the book
It is Sylvia Plath in the kitchen
and St Clement with an anchor around his neck
This is the final bit
thinning away to nothing
This is the end according to Aristotle
what we have all been waiting for
what everything comes down to
the destination we cannot help imagining
a streak of light in the sky
a hat on a peg and outside the cabin falling leaves"
Camille T DungyArk"I will enter you as hope enters me
through blinding liquid light of rain and I
will stay inside until you send me out
I will stay inside until you ground me
We cannot outrun the rain So many
summers I have tried So many summers
But when the rumble calls after the spark
there can be no escape No outstripping
the drench soak the wet sheath the water caul
This is more than you want to hear Much more
than I want to tell you Tabernacle
transporting my life from the desert you
the faith I am born and reborn into
you rescuer deliverer of rain"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""One morning you open

one eye and listing to the south
it bulks like a barn

noiseless derelict

planks horizontal and deeply grooved
A rudder the size of your front door

pivots as you push Once

inside you can smell
the fear of every winged

creeping and four-legged thing

no water no straw
just shadow and bare wood

Where is the one promised

to wake beside you forever
Ox-eyed daisies goldenrod clover—

why are you breathing

among them why dont you gather
the outcast beasts or become one"
Frank StanfordThe Arkansas Prison System"Is like a lyric poem
with seven basic themes
first the cottonpicker
dragging behind it a wagon of testicles
a pair of pliers which can fill in
for a cross in a pinch
then there is the warm pond
between the maiden’s thighs
next we have some friends
of yours and mine
who shall be with us always
Pablo the artist
the pubis of the moon
Pablo the cellist
panther of silence
Pablo the poet
the point of no return
and in case of emergency
the seventh and final theme
of this systematic poem
is the systematic way
death undresses in front of you"
Emily BerryArlene and Esme"In our house we live with Arlene My little sister has a plan
She has what they call a beginner’s mind She sees everything
from an un-given-up perspective I’m frightened I know
Arlene better than anyone she knows me better Esme says
if I’m scared we can’t win But I am scared Arlene drags me
over to the window where the black mould has made
a map of Australia Australia gives me trouble breathing
it’s so far away Arlene points it out and I get the feeling
in my chest my whole life in there twisted up like a snake
It could bite me or her She puts a hand on my breastbone
You’re not strong I want to tell her we can look after ourselves
I want to tell her I’m in charge now but I can still see the dark
blur at the edges I don’t sleep anymore my head is full
of this insomniac light I lie awake watching over my sisters
and I listen to them breathe Esme whispers that I should
wake her if I need to I say I will but I never do Even when
I sleep I dream I can’t sleep and I’m standing there looking
down at them the night pouring from my hands Esme has
a future in mind She’s always laughing She gets up early
and makes buttermilk pancakes using normal milk soured
with lemon juice She tries things out Arlene tells us
to stay away from sharp things or we’ll cut ourselves Esme
does what she likes She grates apple for a new recipe and
cuts her knuckle and laughs I don’t know if I can live my life
I don’t know if I can look after someone as unafraid as Esme
I don’t know how to change what I do the way someone
eating soup will out of habit bite down Esme laughs she’s
serving up apple pancakes with banana and maple syrup
and she saysYou are a whole person A row of mornings fan out
And the pancakes are sweet and slightly gummy with a salt edge"
Anne WintersThe Armada"Through the meridian’s fine blue hairlines the admirals are converging
in their fish-hulled ships with their frogmen and sirens and tanks with knotted chain flails
that beat the ground before them as they crawl

Behind them the cities dim out on the foredeck the admirals sigh
to lean from the curving bows to trail
their fingertips in the water   

All alone on the landmass the Ship’s Artist simply draws what he sees
red men with arms like flesh clubs blue-daubed men with parasol feet
and fish with weeping human faces The sonic boom arrives at his feet

in the palest ripples In the painting Gloriana rides under arms
towards Tilbury Town Her profile shimmers in the sodium lights
that seem to cast no shadows before or behind her

Like compass pencils of light their fingertips spread out
the nervous systems more complex than spiral nebulae
Orchards of mines grow up on the ocean floor

Now under radar they study the green road glowing
and add a late-rising moon The sea so full of maprooms and the cliffs
chalked with weaponry symbols trailing the phosphorescence of minesquads

Only the grassblown Norman ringmounds go on dreaming
of Monet picture hats and streaming scarves
the bunker disguised as a picnic that went on forever

Now the Cathedral at Bayeux with its window and views is rolled up
and the Conqueror’s navy on its blue worsted waves
and Hengist and Horsa the Escorial with its green shoals of ships all are safely rolled up

Behind the Atlantic Wall that Rommel called “Cloud-Cuckoo-Land” the white-and-liver-cows
moo through the milky light The human faces carved
on Norman beams face out to the sea which has grown

this answering forest of rigging And very soon just as soon
as the sea can see the land and the land the sea
the two of them will go to war"
Elizabeth BishopThe Armadillo"for Robert Lowell
This is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail illegal fire balloons appear
Climbing the mountain height

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes like hearts

Once up against the sky its hard
to tell them from the stars—
planets that is—the tinted ones
Venus going down or Mars

or the pale green one With a wind
they flare and falter wobble and toss
but if its still they steer between
the kite sticks of the Southern Cross

receding dwindling solemnly
and steadily forsaking us
or in the downdraft from a peak
suddenly turning dangerous

Last night another big one fell
It splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house
The flame ran down We saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath until
they shrieked up out of sight

The ancient owls nest must have burned
Hastily all alone
a glistening armadillo left the scene
rose-flecked head down tail down

and then a baby rabbit jumped out
short-eared to our surprise
So soft—a handful of intangible ash
with fixed ignited eyes

Too pretty dreamlike mimicry
O falling fire and piercing cry
and panic and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky"
Jehanne DubrowArmed Services Editions"My copy of The Fireside Book of Verse
is as the seller promised—the stapled spine
the paper aged to Army tan—no worse
for wear given the cost of its design
six cents to make and printed on a press
once used for magazines and pulp This book
was never meant to last a war much less
three quarters of a century
I look
for evidence of all the men who scanned
these lines crouched down in holes or lying in
their racks I read the poems secondhand
Someone has creased the page Did he begin
then stop to sleep to clean his gun perhaps
to listen to the bugler playing taps"
Sophie JewettArmistice"The water sings along our keel
The wind falls to a whispering breath
I look into your eyes and feel
No fear of life or death
So near is love so far away
The losing strife of yesterday

We watch the swallow skim and dip
Some magic bids the world be still
Life stands with finger upon lip
Love hath his gentle will
Though hearts have bled and tears have burned
The river floweth unconcerned

We pray the fickle flag of truce
Still float deceitfully and fair
Our eyes must love its sweet abuse
This hour we will not care
Though just beyond to-morrows gate
Arrayed and strong the battle wait"
Wilfred OwenArms and the Boy"Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
How cold steel is and keen with hunger of blood
Blue with all malice like a madmans flash
And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh

Lend him to stroke these blind blunt bullet-leads
Which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads
Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth
Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death

For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple
There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple
And God will grow no talons at his heels
Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls"
Sarah Morgan Bryan PiattArmy of Occupation"At Arlington 
The summer blew its little drifts of sound—
Tangled with wet leaf-shadows and the light
Small breath of scattered morning buds—around
The yellow path through which our footsteps wound
Below the Capitol rose glittering white

There stretched a sleeping army One by one
They took their places until thousands met
No leader’s stars flashed on before and none
Leaned on his sword or stagger’d with his gun—
I wonder if their feet have rested yet

They saw the dust they joined the moving mass
They answer’d the fierce music’s cry for blood
Then straggled here and lay down in the grass—
Wear flowers for such shores whence their feet did pass
Sing tenderly O river’s haunted flood

They had been sick and worn and weary when
They stopp’d on this calm hill beneath the trees
Yet if in some red-clouded dawn again
The country should be calling to her men
Shall the reveille not remember these

Around them underneath the mid-day skies
The dreadful phantoms of the living walk
And by low moons and darkness with their cries—
The mothers sisters wives with faded eyes
Who call still names amid their broken talk

And there is one who comes alone and stands
At his dim fireless hearth—chill’d and oppress’d
By Something he had summon’d to his lands
While the weird pallor of its many hands
Points to his rusted sword in his own breast"
Ted BerriganAround the Fire"What I’m trying to say is that if an experience is
proposed to me—I don’t have any particular interest
in it—Any more than anything else I’m interested in
anything Like I could walk out the door right now and go some
where else I don’t have any center in that sense If you’ll look
in my palm you’ll see that my heart and my head line are
the same and if you’ll look in your palm you’ll see that it’s
different My heart and my head feel exactly the same Me
I like to lay around of a Sunday and drink beer I don’t feel
a necessity for being a mature person in this world I mean
all the grown-ups in the world they’re just playing house all
poets know that How does your head feel How I feel is
what I think I look at you today amp I expect you to look
the same tomorrow If you’re having a nervous breakdown I’m
not going to be looking at you like you’re going to die because
I don’t think you are If you’re a woman you put yourself
somewhere near the beginning and then there’s this other place
you put yourself in terms of everybody “The great cosmetic strange-
ness of the normal deep person” Okay Those were those people—and
I kept telling myself I have to be here because I don’t have
a country How tight is the string And what is on this particular
segment of it And the photographer being black and the writer
me being white fell out at this point And he didn’t want to
look at it—I mean it’s nothing just some drunk Indians riding
Jersey milk cows—but I wanted to see it I mean it was right
in front of my eyes and I wanted therefore to look at it
And death is not any great thing it’s there or it’s not I mean
God is the progenitor of religious impetuousity in the human beast
And Davy Crockett is right on that—I mean he’s gonna shoot a bear
but he’s not gonna shoot a train because the train is gonna run
right over him You can’t shoot the train And I always thought
there was another way to do that And it is necessary to do that
and we bear witness that it is necessary to do it The only distinction
between men and women is five million shits"
Ko UnAround Unmun Temple at ChEongdo"All day long Ive been hidden enmeshed locked in
the shadow of the holy mountain
my body covered with shame
Id hoped there would be a dog
barking furiously
Unable to go forward
unable to go back
at least with the sound of a dog barking
Id attain something   something

Instead of a dog barking there was silence
then the sound of a drum beaten loud amp fast
by a young nun

Into this temple come none of the grand sounds
none of the great thoughts
In the cabbage field heads all the same size
are profiles of young novice nuns amp the priestesses
sitting in Unmun Temple
Young faces
like dew
like hoarfrost"
Hailey LeithauserArrhythmia"The heart of a bear is a cloud-shuttered
mountain The heart of a mountain’s a kiln
The white heart of a moth has nineteen white
chambers The heart of a swan is a swan

The heart of a wasp is a prick of plush
The heart of a skunk is a mink The heart
of an owl is part blood and part chalice
The fey mouse heart rides a dawdy dust-cart

The heart of a kestrel hides a house wren
at nest The heart of lark is a czar
The heart of a scorpion is swidden

and spark The heart of a shark is a gear
Listen and tell thrums the grave heart of humans
Listen well love for it’s pitch dark down here"

Elizabeth BishopArrival at Santos"Here is a coast here is a harbor
here after a meager diet of horizon is some scenery
impractically shaped and—who knows—self-pitying mountains
sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery

with a little church on top of one And warehouses
some of them painted a feeble pink or blue
and some tall uncertain palms Oh tourist
is this how this country is going to answer you

and your immodest demands for a different world
and a better life and complete comprehension
of both at last and immediately
after eighteen days of suspension

Finish your breakfast The tender is coming
a strange and ancient craft flying a strange and brillant rag
So thats the flag I never saw it before
I somehow never thought of there being a flag

but of course there was all along And coins I presume
and paper money they remain to be seen
And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward
myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen

descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters
waiting to be loaded with green coffee beans
Please boy do be more careful with that boat hook
Watch out Oh It has caught Miss Breens

skirt There Miss Breen is about seventy
a retired police lieutenant six feet tall
with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression
Her home when she is at home is in Glens Fall

s New York There We are settled
The customs officials will speak English we hope
and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes
Ports are necessities like postage stamps or soap

but they seldom seem to care what impression they make
or like this only attempt since it does not matter
the unassertive colors of soap or postage stamps—
wasting away like the former slipping the way the latter

do when we mail the letteres we wrote on the boat
either because the glue here is very inferior
or because of the heat We leave Santos at once
we are driving to the interior

January "
Patricia GoedickeThe Arrival"Luggage first the lining of his suit jacket dangling
As always just when you’d given up hope
Nimbly he backs out of the taxi

Eyes nervously extending like brave crabs
Everywhere at once keeping track of his papers
He pilots himself into the home berth

Like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls
Worries flutter around him so thick
It takes him some time to arrive

And you wonder if he’s ever really been happy
When the blue eyes blur
And stare out to sea

Whether it’s only a daydream
Or a long pain that silences him
In such gray distances

You’ll never know but now
Turning to you the delicate mouth
Like a magician

Is curious sensitive playing tricks
Pouting like a wise turtle
It seems he has a secret

With the driver
With the stewardess on the airplane
So that even when he opens his arms

When the warm voice surrounds you
Wraps you in rough bliss
Just before you go under

Suddenly you remember
The beloved does not come
From nowhere out of himself alone

Often he comes slowly carefully
After a long taxi ride
Past many beautiful men and women

And many dead bodies
Mysterious and important companions"
Anne KennedyThe Arrivals"When we arrive at the lounge of everything
with our bags
handfuls of earth   the lives of our grandparents
in our memory devices
we expect an exchange of sorts   that is what
we expect
and I think everyone deep down expects
that we will not turn back
Through a high window we will connect stars
like line drawings
translate the sparkles of the poet
we will
sign the fascinating mouth of the speaker
we will sing
lyrics that someone thought were pretty good
we will sing them
and we will not turn back   we will not

When our footsteps awaken fresh
from a long
complicated journey during which the planet
slid otherwise
we will likely remember a dream we had once
and tell
a version of it to the next person and the next
and realize hopefully
they also have a dream to tell and we will not
do that thing
where we won’t listen to anyone else’s dream
we will listen
and interpret   signing   singing   saying
even though
we have been instructed not to use ings
we will use
the wisdom disseminated by our devices
we will not turn back

we will not
If on arrival there is wringing of hands
we will shake hands
and in the eye of a storm we will make tea
with our brilliant
fading bodies we will do a variety of things
while we can
we will bed down on the steps of the assembly
if we have to
we will bed down in a court of law
and all beds
anyway are temporary and when we see
that
and realize we have traveled through the night
we have traveled
and are not turning back   that
will be the point
at which we will arrive"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""I have been known to birth a mountain whole
a range of them in my belly

I popped them out one by one
The blood-cut son born black

I could not believe the wholeness of him
the crushed diamond of his face

And then the other
who flew from me a shooting star

a twin mirror girl whose orchid face
opened and opened and opened

There were more of them
one born of water one of fire

one for every element
But now my mountain days are done

The red night clouds the afterbirth
the snail shell whorls of them

The unborns we named

Henry Wadsworth LongfellowThe Arrow and the Song"I shot an arrow into the air
It fell to earth I knew not where
For so swiftly it flew the sight
Could not follow it in its flight

I breathed a song into the air
It fell to earth I knew not where
For who has sight so keen and strong
That it can follow the flight of song

Long long afterward in an oak
I found the arrow still unbroke
And the song from beginning to end
I found again in the heart of a friend"
Jason ShinderArrow Breaking Apart"While lovers sleep I dig my nails into the earth

holding up traffic Just now a cloud has pulled up
while I was talking to the Emptiness

of the Universe and my voice plugged into the waves

at the bottom of the ocean
My heart is taped up like a child’s drawing

of the moon over the broken window of the sky

where the wind always comes back to fill my lungs
I will dance on my shadow I will open my mouth

with the air inside my mother’s coffin

I will be the arrow breaking apart in the body
of the blackbird which appears at my window singing"
Robert PackArrowhead"Where two streams joined we met
By accident sitting upon an outcropping of rock
With only the intent of watching
Water flow beneath unwinding water
Facing up-stream she held a flower
To the sun as I leaned back and found
An arrowhead inside a crevice which lay there
As if someone had left it by intent
As an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water
Swirling upon stone and thus
Transform the accident of meeting her—
Ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand—
Into stark fact as obdurate as rock
Could I have called ""Look at this arrowhead
I just found here"" Would she have thought
""An accident thats credible""
Or feared that my intent was sinister
And that the implication of the arrowhead
Unlike the radiant white flower or
The two streams merging into faster water
Casting up colored spume
Had been contrived by me certain as rock
That forms by geologic laws
She had to know an arrowhead
Is humanly designed with the intent to kill
Though now its harmless as a flower
Decorating someones hair
Or water organized into a garden fountain
An arrowhead can now be used
As an adornment for a necklace
Like a flower in a painting where a stream
Leaps past a light-reflecting rock
With nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident
And so our accidental meeting on the rock
Flowed by a flower cast upon the water
With intent unknown and all
Thats left now is the arrowhead"
A E StallingsArrowhead Hunting"The land is full of what was lost Whats hidden
Rises to the surface after rain
In new-ploughed fields and fields stubbled again
The clay shards foot and lip that heaped the midden

And here and there a blade or flakes of blade
A patient art knapped from a core of flint
Most broken few as coins new from the mint
Perfect shot through time as through a glade

You cannot help but think how they were lost
The quarry fletched shaft in its flank the blood
Whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood
Not just the meat but what the weapon cost—

O hapless hunter though your aim was true—
The wounded hart spooked fleeting in its fear—
And the sharpness honed with longing year by year
Buried deeper found someday but not by you"
Tony HoaglandArrows"When a beautiful woman wakes up
she checks to see if her beauty is still there
When a sick person wakes up
he checks to see if he continues to be sick

He takes the first pills in a thirty-pill day
looks out the window at a sky
where a time-release sun is crawling
through the milky X ray of a cloud

    

I sing the body like a burnt-out fuse box
the wires crossed the panel lit
by red malfunction lights the pistons firing
out of sequence
the warning sirens blatting in the empty halls

and the hero is trapped in a traffic jam
the message doesn’t reach its destination
the angel falls down into the body of a dog
and is speechless

tearing at itself with fast white teeth
and the consciousness twists evasively
like a sheet of paper
traveled by blue tongues of flame

    

In the famous painting the saint
looks steadfastly heavenward
away from the physical indignity below

the fascinating spectacle
of his own body
bristling with arrows
he looks up
as if he were already adamantly elsewhere
exerting that power of denial
the soul is famous for
that ability to say “None of this is real

Nothing that happened here on earth
and who I thought I was
and nothing that I did or that was done to me
was ever real”"
John UntereckerArroyo Flash Flood"The canyon walls close in again
slant light a silver glare in brown water
The water is only knee deep but when the boy reaches the
boulders—
purple dark silvered by the smash of brute water—
water will tear at his chest and arms
The walls of the canyon are brilliant in late light
They would have glared red and gold for his drowned camera
splashed blood to his left to his right a wall of sun laddered
with boulders

More than boulders Some stranger once fought down this
cliffside
his rope of twisted dry vines strung boulder to boulder
clifftop to arroyo Escape Escape maybe Maybe bones
in the desert
I think of hands scuffed raw from the braiding

Almost… Water froths over the boulders
tugs at the boy’s footing Almost…
The blood cliff to his left blinds him Blind nails scrape at
two boulders
a torn vine whipping somewhere above him

He wedges knees against polished rock pressing up clawing
slick stone
Now Rope cutting his hand he skids underwater
silver and froth a film of bright blood staining his eyes
But he drags hand over hand up out of the water climbing
the sun
hand over hand the ancient vines holding
boulders for foothold up out of that canyon"
J V CunninghamArs Amoris"Speak to her heart
That manic force
When wits depart
Forbids remorse

Dream with her dreaming
Until her lust
Seems to her seeming
An act of trust

Do without doing

Veils the ensuing
And brief commotion"
Archibald MacLeishArs Poetica"A poem should be palpable and mute
As a globed fruit

Dumb
As old medallions to the thumb

Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—

A poem should be wordless
As the flight of birds



A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs

Leaving as the moon releases
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees

Leaving as the moon behind the winter leaves
Memory by memory the mind—

A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs



A poem should be equal to
Not true

For all the history of grief
An empty doorway and a maple leaf

For love
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—

A poem should not mean
But be"
Eleanor WilnerArs Poetica"To grasp like Prometheus the fire — without

the power to give it away 

— Betty Adcock
At first a silhouette on the horizon then
turning solid like Schiller coming up the path to meet
the adorable sisters and they pretending not to watch

their hearts all the time pounding
driven by the same spring force that would

tear them apart the same force that drives
the salmon upriver against the current the odds
back to the home pool even as
the autumn mind in spite of itself

turns backward with the same feverish glow as autumn
gives to the summer’s leaves a deceptive glamour
warming the past with an amber light like brandy
held up to the fire or the sun sinking at dusk
into the water into the Baltic Sea
each night where in the mythical depths

of Lithuanian folktale lies the amber castle
of the female sun burning in the dark water
a globe the color of harvest aglow
there in the depths of the past though
the amber congealed sap of a once

living force is broken into bits and the mythic
castle with it — strung now as beads and hung
a charm around the neck of a daughter
like the one in a Greek dream picking flowers
when the earth opened

and in a swirl of violet cape and the pounding of hoofs
the dark god broke out of the earth
driven by the same spring force consequential
and mortal
and up there hanging over the mythic

fields of what recurs and recurs though never the same
and never to be reconciled — what is that
A hot air balloon filled

with passengers who paid to be raised
in a basket to be up there looking down on
the ground where they live a place shrunken now
beneath their gaze while their bloated shadow floats
like a jellyfish in a green sea barely a smudge on the pastures below
the trace of their passage less than a breath of smoke
from a coal-fired engine — a blast of tarnished air
from the actual past heavy metal delivered from memory
Useless to warn the girl whose

hand will always be reaching out for the flowers or
the sisters inflamed with Schiller as he with the tricolor
dream of a world he could never inhabit 
useless to comfort

the eyeless Tiresias who knew how terrible was
wisdom when it knew itself useless
and useless to read

the names on the shining black wall of the Vietnam
Memorial the text of exactly what war has accomplished —
and look there standing high above the tragic scene

not the little figures of the wise ancients that Yeats saw
carved into the deep blue stone — but there standing high
above Arlington against the blank lapis of the sky
a horse with the torso and head of a man yes
it is Chiron the last of the hybrids the wise and terribly wounded
centaur for whom immortality was a curse
and he gave it away

to Prometheus who stole the god’s fire and gave it away
as art gives the power to give it away
for that fire is the gift that cannot be held
for it will burn to an ash those born
and born again war without end who would hold it"
Czeslaw MiloszArs Poetica"I have always aspired to a more spacious form
that would be free from the claims of poetry or prose
and would let us understand each other without exposing
the author or reader to sublime agonies

In the very essence of poetry there is something indecent
a thing is brought forth which we didn’t know we had in us
so we blink our eyes as if a tiger had sprung out
and stood in the light lashing his tail

That’s why poetry is rightly said to be dictated by a daimonion
though it’s an exaggeration to maintain that he must be an angel
It’s hard to guess where that pride of poets comes from
when so often they’re put to shame by the disclosure of their frailty

What reasonable man would like to be a city of demons
who behave as if they were at home speak in many tongues
and who not satisfied with stealing his lips or hand
work at changing his destiny for their convenience

It’s true that what is morbid is highly valued today
and so you may think that I am only joking
or that I’ve devised just one more means
of praising Art with the help of irony

There was a time when only wise books were read
helping us to bear our pain and misery
This after all is not quite the same
as leafing through a thousand works fresh from psychiatric clinics

And yet the world is different from what it seems to be
and we are other than how we see ourselves in our ravings
People therefore preserve silent integrity
thus earning the respect of their relatives and neighbors

The purpose of poetry is to remind us
how difficult it is to remain just one person
for our house is open there are no keys in the doors
and invisible guests come in and out at will

What Im saying here is not I agree poetry
as poems should be written rarely and reluctantly
under unbearable duress and only with the hope
that good spirits not evil ones choose us for their instrument

Berkeley "
Ruth Irupé SanabriaArs Poetica"Story takes her skin Story takes her bones
She finds her toes and her fingertips
When she speaks like salmon running
the dead and the living converge
The river of memory rocks
the hunger of claws and tongues
Electricity swallows itself back
through its double-prod picana
bullets dislodge themselves from
their chore of destroying
the same day over and over again
and from the caverns of fear and revision
skin resurrects the skin
Each sentence closes in
like the crawl of split skin
sealing its red wet avulsion

The enormity of the pending night scares the seven assassins on trial
They understand that in hell they will eat their own throats"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""I wanted to tell the veterinary assistant about the cat video Jason sent me
But I resisted for fear shed think it strange
I am very lonely
Yesterday my boyfriend called me drunk again
And interspersed between ringing tears and clinginess
He screamed at me with a kind of bitterness
No other human had before to my ears
And told me that I was no good
Well maybe he didnt mean that
But that is what I heard
When he told me my life was not worthwhile
And my lifes work the work of the elite
I say I want to save the world but really
I want to write poems all day
I want to rise write poems go to sleep
Write poems in my sleep
Make my dreams poems
Make my body a poem with beautiful clothes
I want my face to be a poem
I have just learned how to apply
Eyeliner to the corners of my eyes to make them appear wide
There is a romantic abandon in me always
I want to feel the dread for others
I can feel it through song
Only through song am I able to sum up so many words into a few
Like when he said I am no good
I am no good
Goodness is not the point anymore
Holding on to things
Now thats the point"
Paul VerlaineArs Poetica"for Charles Morice
Music first and foremost In your verse
Choose those meters odd of syllable
Supple in the air vague flexible
Free of pounding beat heavy or terse

Choose the words you use—now right now wrong—
With abandon when the poet’s vision
Couples the Precise with Imprecision
Best the giddy shadows of his song

Eyes veiled hidden dark with mystery
Sunshine trembling in the noonday glare
Starlight in the tepid autumn air
Shimmering in night-blue filigree

For Nuance not Color absolute
Is your goal subtle and shaded hue
Nuance It alone is what lets you
Marry dream to dream and horn to flute

Shun all cruel and ruthless Railleries
Hurtful Quip lewd Laughter that appall
Heaven Azure-eyed to tears and all
Garlic-stench scullery recipes

Take vain Eloquence and wring its neck
Best you keep your Rhyme sober and sound
Lest it wander reinless and unbound—
How far Who can say—if not in check

Rhyme Who will its infamies revile
What deaf child what Black of little wit
Forged with worthless bauble fashioned it
False and hollow-sounding to the file

Music first and foremost and forever
Let your verse be what goes soaring sighing
Set free fleeing from the soul gone flying
Off to other skies and loves wherever

Let your verse be aimless chance delighting
In good-omened fortune sprinkled over
Dawn’s wind bristling scents of mint thyme clover   
All the rest is nothing more than writing"
Elizabeth AlexanderArs Poetica # I Believe"Poetry I tell my students
is idiosyncratic Poetry

is where we are ourselves
though Sterling Brown said

“Every ‘I’ is a dramatic ‘I’”
digging in the clam flats

for the shell that snaps
emptying the proverbial pocketbook

Poetry is what you find
in the dirt in the corner

overhear on the bus God
in the details the only way

to get from here to there
Poetry and now my voice is rising

is not all love love love
and I’m sorry the dog died

Poetry here I hear myself loudest
is the human voice

and are we not of interest to each other"
Henry Wadsworth LongfellowThe Arsenal at Springfield"This is the Arsenal From floor to ceiling
Like a huge organ rise the burnished arms
But from their silent pipes no anthem pealing
Startles the villages with strange alarms

Ah what a sound will rise how wild and dreary
When the death-angel touches those swift keys
What loud lament and dismal Miserere
Will mingle with their awful symphonies

I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus
The cries of agony the endless groan
Which through the ages that have gone before us
In long reverberations reach our own

On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer
Through Cimbric forest roars the Norsemans song
And loud amid the universal clamor
Oer distant deserts sounds the Tartar gong

I hear the Florentine who from his palace
Wheels out his battle-bell with dreadful din
And Aztec priests upon their teocallis
Beat the wild war-drums made of serpents skin

The tumult of each sacked and burning village
The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns
The soldiers revels in the midst of pillage
The wail of famine in beleaguered towns

The bursting shell the gateway wrenched asunder
The rattling musketry the clashing blade
And ever and anon in tones of thunder
The diapason of the cannonade

Is it O man with such discordant noises
With such accursed instruments as these
Thou drownest Natures sweet and kindly voices
And jarrest the celestial harmonies

Were half the power that fills the world with terror
Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts
Given to redeem the human mind from error
There were no need of arsenals or forts

The warriors name would be a name abhorred
And every nation that should lift again
Its hand against a brother on its forehead
Would wear forevermore the curse of Cain

Down the dark future through long generations
The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease
And like a bell with solemn sweet vibrations
I hear once more the voice of Christ say ""Peace""

Peace and no longer from its brazen portals
The blast of Wars great organ shakes the skies
But beautiful as songs of the immortals
The holy melodies of love arise"
Herman MelvilleArt"In placid hours well-pleased we dream
Of many a brave unbodied scheme
But form to lend pulsed life create
What unlike things must meet and mate
A flame to melt—a wind to freeze
Sad patience—joyous energies
Humility—yet pride and scorn
Instinct and study love and hate
Audacity—reverence These must mate
And fuse with Jacob’s mystic heart
To wrestle with the angel—Art"
Sydney LeaArt"—for Fleda
It seems so different art that moves me now
From the sort of art I longed for long ago
Soaring Vatic Agon

I waited yesterday on the unsure shoulder
Of a drenched back road From my car I could behold
Our highway agent Gordon

Fill a rut with a spade climb up on his grader
And smooth things smooth as the top of a kitchen table
There were frost heaves by the score

And culverts clotted shut by April floods
So it was brilliant what Gordon did with mud
On Wallace Hill Pure mire

Out there The road goes narrow as a needle
On which you might wonder could dance how many angels
I dont care I didnt

No earthly need to summon spirits daemons
No sign of them at all Nor would I dream one
I might have once but wouldnt

Nor gyre nor golem Nor great Leviathan
Nor djinn Nor fiend Nor signifying wind
Nor Elementargeist

That lingering in that lane might make me conjure
I had to get somewhere and fetch my daughter
To bring her home Sweet Christ

She might be standing in that mix of sleet
And ugly rain which called for Gordons art
Im trying to be a grownup

Better late than never I suppose
Or am I only jaded I dont know
It was as though Id shown up

Just to see him wield his spade and blade out there
It kept me from surmising some furor
divinis Why should I bother

Now that I moved on thanks be to Gordon
Who signaled with his thumb for me to pass him
He pulled the grader over

Yes give me something useful here I said
Impromptu In my car it sounded odd
To say it now sounds different

I hope that Gordon watched me yesterday
As I signaled back Id never have made my way
Without a skillful agent

I hope he saw me wave"

Anne CorayThe Art of Being"The fern in the rain breathes the silver message
Stay lie low Play your dark reeds
and relearn the beauty of absorption
There is nothing beyond the rotten log
covered with leaves and needles
Forget the light emerging with its golden wick
Raise your face to the water-laden frond
A thousand blossoms will fall into your arms"
William ArchilaThe Art of Exile"On the Pan American Highway somewhere
between the north and south continent
you come across a chain of volcanoes

a coast with a thick growth of palm trees
crunching waves of the sea an isthmus
Neruda called “slender earth like a whip”

When the road bends turns into a street
the walls splattered with “Yanqui Go Home”
you see a boy fifteen years old

barefoot sniffing glue in a small plastic bag
An old woman in an apron will step out
say “This is the right street”

In the public square there will be no friend
from school to welcome you no drive
to Sonsonate city of coconuts

no one to order cold Pilseners oyster
cocktails or convince the waitress
into dancing a cumbia or two with you

Instead at the local bar you’ll raise
a bottle next to strangers stub
your cigarette out on the floor

You’ll watch a country ten years
after the civil war an old man sitting
on the curb head between knees

open hand stretched out
Everything will hurt your hair
your toenails even your shoes

You’ll curse dusty streets demented
sun slowly burning the nape of your neck
stray dogs following you to the park

By nightfall you drag yourself back to the bars
looking for a lost country in a shot of Tíc Táck
Against the wall three men with their guitars

When you lie on a hotel bed
too tired to sleep when you feel torn
twisted like an old newspaper blown

from city to city you have reached the place
You have begun to speak like a man
by the side of the road barefoot"
Claire PotterThe Art of Sideways"Northern hemisphere
it’s almost Christmas
Sunlight  withdrawing into its darkest shell of green
coils
ring by ring
like a yellow snake
in a tight burrow
The snake’s sleep
maps an origin
pinpoints the start
of where morning lies — its polished skin
a simple clock
turning every so often
leaving a scaled
topography behind
But just as rain can fall sideways
and eyes look aslant
might a northern winter
not widen light in the same way
a snake
exceeds its skin
Last summer
I stood over a sheath of snake
in the bush
The tail tapered
the head was marked
with the shape
and angle
of invisible eyes
It could have been a hairnet or a ghost
but it was quieter than that
It could have been laid out
across a plate of vine leaves
A seamstress could have used it as tulle
a fisherman as netting
the desert salt
as cracks
Trees are empty on the sidewalk
their fallen leaves
layered
and overlapping
like shelves of ancient papyruses
One tree casts a long shadow
two arms striking upwards
as though piqued
by pavement light
Between the shadow lying flat and still
and the tree standing
long and tall
there is an angle of forty-five degrees
There is Icarus
falling from blue
to decimal
to amber
The distance between north
and south
is mapped
with the shape
and angle
of his eyes
The snake’s skin is colorless
his eye invincible
The winter light is warm
piercing darkness
radiating
a trajectory that points in all
directions"
Safiya SinclairThe Art of Unselfing"The mind’s black kettle hisses its wild
exigencies at every turn The hour before the coffee
and the hour after

Penscratch of the gone morning woman
a pitched hysteria watching the mad-ant scramble
her small wants devouring

Her binge and skin-thrall
Her old selves being shuffled off into labyrinths
this birdless sky a longing

Her moth-mouth rabble unfacing
touch-and-go months under winter torn letters
under floorboards

each fickle moon pecked through with doubt
And one spoiled onion Pale Cyclops
on her kitchen counter

now sprouting green missives
some act of contrition neighbor-god’s vacuum
a loud rule thrown down

Her mother now on the line saying too much
This island is not a martyr You tinker too much
with each gaunt memory your youth

and its unweeding Not everything blooms here
a private history — consider this immutable Consider
our galloping sun its life

Your starved homesickness The paper wasp kingdom
you set fire to watched for days until it burnt a city in you
Until a family your hands could not save

became the hurricane How love is still unrooting you
And how to grow a new body — to let each word be the wild rain
swallowed pure like an antidote

Her mother at the airport saying don’t come back
Love your landlocked city Money Buy a coat
And even exile can be glamorous

Some nights she calls across the deaf ocean to no one
in particular No answer Her heart’s double-vault
a muted hydra

This hour a purge

of  its own unselfing
She must make a home of it"
Shara McCallumThe Art Room"for my sisters
Because we did not have threads
of turquoise silver and gold
we could not sew a sun nor sky
And our hands became balls of fire
And our arms spread open like wings

Because we had no chalk or pastels
no toad forest or morning-grass slats
of paper we had no colour
for creatures So we squatted
and sprang squatted and sprang

Four young girls plaits heavy
on our backs our feet were beating
drums drawing rhythms from the floor
our mouths became woodwinds
our tongues touched teeth and were reeds"
Percy sshe ShelleyArt thou pale for weariness"Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth
Wandering companionless
Among the stars that have a different birth
And ever changing like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy"
James Weldon JohnsonArt vs Trade"Trade Trade versus Art
Brain Brain versus Heart
Oh the earthiness of these hard-hearted times
When clinking dollars and jingling dimes
Drown all the finer music of the soul

Life as an Octopus with but this creed
That all the world was made to serve his greed
Trade has spread out his mighty myriad claw
And drawn into his foul polluted maw
The brightest and the best
Well nigh
Has he drained dry
The sacred fount of Truth
And if forsooth
He has left yet some struggling streams from it to go
He has contaminated so their flow
That Truth scarce is it true

Poor Art with struggling gasp
Lies strangled dying in his mighty grasp
He locks his grimy fingers ’bout her snowy throat so tender
Is there no power to rescue her protect defend her
Shall Art be left to perish
Shall all the images her shrines cherish
Be left to this iconoclast to vulgar Trade

Oh that mankind had less of Brain and more of Heart
Oh that the world had less of Trade and more of Art
Then would there be less grinding down the poor
Then would men learn to love each other more
For Trade stalks like a giant through the land
Bearing aloft the rich in his high hand
While down beneath his mighty ponderous tread
He crushes those who cry for daily bread"
James McMichaelThe Artichoke"The Artichoke

She bore only the heart
Worked at the stem with her
Fingers pulling it to her
And into her like a cord

She would sustain him
Would cover his heart
The hairy needles
And the bigger leaves

These she licked into shape
Tipping each with its point
He is the mud-flower
The thorny hugger


The Asparagus

She sent packs of great beasts to pass
Over him trailing belly-fur and dust
Bending their nostrils to his frail spear
This was to toughen him For what
Stupidly like a squirrel standing up
Looking here and there looking to all sides

He is cut down and taken away
She can smell him steaming his crowns
Already tender his spine giving in
Now he is threatening to wither terribly
And slip from the water altogether
And billow through the kitchen like prayer


The Cauliflower

Her words clot in his head
He presses himself to remember
And feels the skin peel back
The skull bleach crack fall away

All thats left of him is the brain
Its tissue knotting up to shade him
The pain of its light pulsing
How to move how to move


Herbs

Before fog leaves the scrub-oak
Or the grasses of the downland
Take dragonwort under the black alder
Take cockspur grass and henbane
The belladonna the deadly nightshade
Free them as you would a spiders web
Singing over them Out little wen
Out little wen
Sing this into the mouth of the woman


Corn

I am the corn quail
What I do is quick
You will know only
The muffled clucking
The scurry the first
Shiver of feathers
And I will be up
I will be in your
Head with no way out
Wings beating at the
Air behind your eyes


Celery

The hope with
water is that it
will conceal nothing

that a clearness
will follow upon it
like the clearness
after much rain

or the clearness
where the air
reaches to the river
and touches it

where the rain
falls from the trees
into the river


Bell Pepper

To find enough rooms for the gathering
The walls go on alone not waiting
For corners but thinking of sleeves
And how the wind fills them and the snow
Fills them and how cold it is without
Fires when there are not enough rooms


Potatoes

It had been growing in her like vegetables
She was going into the ground where it could
Do better where she could have potatoes

They would be small and easily mistaken
For stones It would fall to her to
Sort them out persuade them to stay

Close to her comforting her letting her
Wear them on her body in her hair
Helping her hold always very still"
Peter SpagnuoloArtifice"The plastic Great Horned Owl stuck with glue
on the stamped tin corbelled cornice lip
impresses no one — not the starlings that dip
and stitch nor pigeons as they fluff and coo
around its feet And vinyl siding’s too
regular — each molded faux-grained strip
identical but for dents and that drip
of   bird shit from a sill What if all you
might say speaks like crafted ersatz things
mimicry in a tongue you barely know
Your owl signs death the cornice stone the fake
clapboard conjures farmhouse While just below
the ledge a wren’s mindless gestures make
an altar of twigs in veneration of wings"

I remain the eclipse of each sound
as I push through the soil
to the icons that run no more my stutters

we dwell in the pull of the Sea the moon
shaves our brain onto the plate and layers

who dwell in the exterior layer of our souls

to reduce the numerical coldness

George HerbertArtillery"As I one evening sat before my cell
Methought a star did shoot into my lap
I rose and shook my clothes as knowing well
That from small fires comes oft no small mishap
When suddenly I heard one say
“Do as thou usest disobey
Expel good motions from thy breast
Which have the face of fire but end in rest”

I who had heard of music in the spheres
But not of speech in stars began to muse
But turning to my God whose ministers
The stars and all things are “If I refuse
Dread Lord” said I “so oft my good
Then I refuse not ev’n with blood
To wash away my stubborn thought
For I will do or suffer what I ought

“But I have also stars and shooters too
Born where thy servants both artilleries use
My tears and prayers night and day do woo
And work up to thee yet thou dost refuse
Not but I am I must say still
Much more obliged to do thy will
Than thou to grant mine but because
Thy promise now hath ev’n set thee thy laws

“Then we are shooters both and thou dost deign
To enter combat with us and contest
With thine own clay But I would parley fain
Shun not my arrows and behold my breast
Yet if thou shunnest I am thine
I must be so if I am mine
There is no articling with thee
I am but finite yet thine infinitely”"

Amy LowellThe Artist"Why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples
Why do you dim yourself with folded silks
Do you not see that I can buy brocades in any draper’s shop
And that I am choked in the twilight of all these colors
How pale you would be and startling—
How quiet
But your curves would spring upward
Like a clear jet of flung water
You would quiver like a shot-up spray of water
You would waver and relapse and tremble
And I too should tremble
Watching

Murex-dyes and tinsel—
And yet I think I could bear your beauty unshaded"

All I’ve ever made

Fatted from the day

No marvel no harvest

With heart

senseless

Spectacular in its way
its way of not seeing
congealing dayless

In that hopeful haunting

where sleek white boats

everything here
the color of honey and sand
everything there
verges on catastrophe
a constant preoccupation
with real estate

everything here
a calm horizon
taut bodies
carefully nurtured
oiled amp gleaming

i read your poem
over and over
turning my head
from prying eyes
the low hum
of women singing
in another room

i switch stations
on the radio
turn up the volume
i almost touch

women sprawl
like cats
on each others laps
licking the salt

and i walk
in search
of the portuguese fishermen
who hide

the bleak blond dunes

Jon LeonArts amp Technology"I like to feel like a Champion Listening to Frankie Valli say ""I cant
take my eyes off of you"" I feel like New York City is a scale model in my
penthouse in North Carolina where I study economics capital markets
and the World Bank I like to look into a scene from the top of a building in
my hometown down at the traders who are moving here from New York
City because New York City started to be kind of like a losing place for
wealth creation Now I look down on them and say to myself ""Im too big
to fail"" I take my keys off of the ledge and walk down the condominium
tower overlooking the entire city When I reach the parking deck I open
the door of a  Mercedes Benz  SL and coast to a place called High
Street Im at High Street knocking back a gin and tonic with three girls
I met at the Arts amp Technology Center conference on the decline of the
book We have a laugh about the old guard who make a book bound in
glue and then pinch angel dust off our palms At this point Im so high Im
like look why dont we excuse ourselves and go up to my condominium
tower Ive just invested  million dollars in They are like uh we can do
that So we pile into my  SL and ride to the tower listening to the music
of Frankie Valli transform our night into a piece of artwork Nearly there
I look around at the Arts amp Technology girls and sort of hum to myself
I feel like Ive hit a milestone in my evening when we trip into the foyer
of my massive penthouse that has those gleaming glass cubes set into the
wall you see in Miami or Miami Beach From the cubes a glimmer of the
prosperity circling this region pierces the dark in the form of an orange-
yellow beam of fluorescent light One of the girls is removing her jewelry
and Im like no dont She takes off her clothes instead and lies face down
on the carpet At the stereo I play a song by Frankie Valli The other two
are kind of standing around surprised I think by the curtain of paperback
books lining the north wall Those are only bound books I tell them
while I finger the Kindle on my coffee table It is the new large Kindle
and we are looking at a book called Boredom by Alberto Moravia taking
turns reading passages from the screen When we get to the part when
the boho girl is fucking the protagonist the totally white breast of one of
the Arts amp Technology girls slips coolly from her blouse Pretending not
to notice I continue to read in my turn The girl sitting on the other side
of me is wearing some totally white string of pearls and shes removing
everything but the pearls I continue to read the screen while the Arts
amp Technology girls start to make out like I had been planning for them
to do ever since we licked angel dust off each others palms I get up and
go to the stereo set the needle back to the gold record ""Cant Take My
Eyes Off You"" and walk calmly to the sofa Once Im there I melt into the
sand-rubbed upholstery with the Arts amp Technology girls who havent
yet passed out on the floor While Im lying with my back to the armrest
I glimpse a piece of sky Ive seen only in films of the old grain Its a wild
purple darkness with a bright white hole in it Im thinking to myself
God my personal Jesus Christ and saviour I want you to come down
here through that hole in the night and join me in Eden"

Bone-riddled ground And up the paths
The endless altered people came

Washing at their identity
Now helpless in the hollow of
An unarmorial age a trough
Of smoke in slow suspended
skeins
skeins
Used figuratively a skein is a quantity of thread

Above their scrap of history
Only an
Only an
When first published in June  in the London Magazine the line began Only their
attitude remains

Time has transfigured them into
Untruth The stone fidelity
They hardly meant has come to be
Their final
blazon
blazon
Both a coat of arms and a public proclamation
 and to prove
Our almost-instinct almost true
What will survive of us is love"

Vidyan RavinthiranAs a child"because my voice was not the right voice
and could not be understood I stood
before the mirror— a murky glassen word
this mouth can’t shape right to this day — and was made
to watch my teeth and lips being imprecise
So this is why I come across a Southron
and not from Yorkshire or Sri Lankan but I’ll complain
no more about this clarified and potent tongue

for when the moustached gent at US Customs
asked me in his hapless twang
are you a terrorist my borrowed posh it sure
abashed that poor colonial and it was of course
what my child-face perceived or could not in the glass
which made of me a scrutineer of sound
a listener for and into every glitch
in the aathma the script the avid void of English"
Ed RobersonAs at the Far Edge of Circling"
As at the far edge of circling the country
facing suddenly the other ocean
the boundless edge of what I had wanted
to know I stepped
into my answers’ shadow ocean

the tightening curl of the corners
of outdated old paperbacks
breakers
a crumble surf of tiny dry triangles around
my ankles sinking in my stand

taken
that the horizon written
by the spin of my compass is
that this is
is not enough
a point to turn around on

is like a skin
that falls short of edge
as a rug
that covers a no longer
natural spot no longer existent
to live on from
the map of my person
come to the end of
but not done

That country crossed was what I could imagine
and that little spit of answer is the shadow—
not the ocean which casts it—
that I step next
into
to be cleansed of question

But not of seeking
…it as
if simplified for the seeking
come to its end at this body"
Jimmy Santiago BacaAs Children Know"Elm branches radiate green heat
blackbirds stiffly strut across fields
Beneath bedroom wood floor I feel earth—
bread in an oven that slowly swells
simmering my Navajo blanket thread-crust
as white-feathered and corn-tasseled
Corn Dancers rise in a line follow my calf
vanish in a rumple and surface at my knee-cliff
chanting Wearing shagged buffalo headgear
Buffalo Dancer chases Deer Woman across
Sleeping Leg mountain Branches of wild rose
trees rattle seeds Deer Woman fades into hills
of beige background Red Bird
of my heart thrashes wildly after her
What a stupid man I have been
How good to let imagination go
step over worrisome events
those hacked logs
tumbled about
in the driveway
Let decisions go
Let them blow
like school children’s papers
against the fence
rattling in the afternoon wind
This Red Bird
of my heart thrashes within the tidy appearance
I offer the world
topples what I erect snares what I set free
dashes what I’ve put together
indulges in things left unfinished
and my world is left as children know
left as toys after dark in the sandbox"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""I dont see the point of
remembering you youre too boring
Iowa City Iowa
much duller topologically than
Needles California Im here
in the Rebel Motel with
my grape-colored sweater
and maté tea whose smoky odors
bound up with first rooms and foods here
sex and snow I
write about Needles
Herman and rocks the storys called
“As Good as Anything” and in it
daft Herman—true local
of Needles—says
“Rocks is as good as anything”
I figured that out summer after
first love affair in New York
hung out home at a rock shop
inspecting geodes and thunder eggs
Arsenic samples and petrified
dinosaur dung
What can I say about Iowa City
everyones an academic poetry
groupie I havent yet written a poem
theres a bar where for  cents a
meal of boiled egg and tiny beer
Really I dont know what kind of poetry—
whats the name of the make they
use here—or what kinds of
poetry live people write in the world
Is there a right and wrong poetry one might
still ask as I patronize
retrospectively the Iowa style
characterized as I remember
by the assumption of desperation
boredom behind two-story houses
divorce incomes fields pigs
getting into pants well not really
in poems well no “well”s and all
in the costive mode
of men who—and the suicidal women—
want to be culpable for something
settle for being mean to their wives
and writing dour stanzas God this is bitchy
I modeled for art classes
thats rather interesting
the hypocrisy nobody needs
to paint nude women
they just like to So here I am
naked for art which is a lot of
dumb fucks I already know
same with poetry
Written and judged by Those befoibled guys
who think—you know—
the poetic moments a pocket in
pool where can I publish it what can
I do to my second or third wife now
Nothing happens in Iowa so
can I myself change here Yes
I can start to become contemptuous
is that good or bad probably bad
In New York Id developed a philosophy
of sympathy and spiritual equality
out the window easily upon
my first meeting real assholes
“A rocks as good as anything”
there are no rocks in Iowa
shit-black soil a tree or two
no mountain or tall edifice
University drabs peeping Toms anti-war
riots visiting poets
treated like royalty especially if
they fuck the locals or have a record
of fighting colorfully with their wives
You can go to the movies once a week
like in Needles You can fuck
a visiting poet you can be paraded before
a visiting poet as fuckable but not fuck
You can write your first poems
thinking you might as well
since the most stupid people in the universe
are writing their five hundredth here
Im doing that now What
difference does it make
I like my poems Theyre
as good as rocks"

Russian hedge fund inspector and one
who called himself The Champ All
night I felt fine crystals cutting
my lips like rising up through
a hailstorm And the great vacuum
cleaner that cannot be filled moved
through my chest gathering
conversation dust and discharging
it through my borehole During
one of many silences The Champ
took off his face and thus were many

Walt WhitmanAs I Ebb’d with the Ocean of Life"
As I ebb’d with the ocean of life
As I wended the shores I know
As I walk’d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok
Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant
Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways
I musing late in the autumn day gazing off southward
Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems
Was seiz’d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot
The rim the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe

Fascinated my eyes reverting from the south dropt to follow those slender windrows
Chaff straw splinters of wood weeds and the sea-gluten
Scum scales from shining rocks leaves of salt-lettuce left by the tide
Miles walking the sound of breaking waves the other side of me
Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses
These you presented to me you fish-shaped island
As I wended the shores I know
As I walk’d with that electric self seeking types



As I wend to the shores I know not
As I list to the dirge the voices of men and women wreck’d
As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me
As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer
I too but signify at the utmost a little wash’d-up drift
A few sands and dead leaves to gather
Gather and merge myself as part of the sands and drift

O baffled balk’d bent to the very earth
Oppress’d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth
Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am
But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch’d untold altogether unreach’d
Withdrawn far mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows
With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written
Pointing in silence to these songs and then to the sand beneath

I perceive I have not really understood any thing not a single object and that no man ever can
Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me
Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all



You oceans both I close with you
We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift knowing not why
These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all

You friable shore with trails of debris
You fish-shaped island I take what is underfoot
What is yours is mine my father

I too Paumanok
I too have bubbled up floated the measureless float and been wash’d on your shores
I too am but a trail of drift and debris
I too leave little wrecks upon you you fish-shaped island

I throw myself upon your breast my father
I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me
I hold you so firm till you answer me something

Kiss me my father
Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love
Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy



Ebb ocean of life the flow will return
Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother
Endlessly cry for your castaways but fear not deny not me
Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you

I mean tenderly by you and all
I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead and following me and mine

Me and mine loose windrows little corpses
Froth snowy white and bubbles
See from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last
See the prismatic colors glistening and rolling
Tufts of straw sands fragments
Buoy’d hither from many moods one contradicting another
From the storm the long calm the darkness the swell
Musing pondering a breath a briny tear a dab of liquid or soil
Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown
A limp blossom or two torn just as much over waves floating drifted at random
Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature
Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets
We capricious brought hither we know not whence spread out before you
You up there walking or sitting
Whoever you are we too lie in drifts at your feet"
Thulani Davisas i fly over this time"for Dianne McIntyre
as i fly over this time
rising over only this
so much painted suffering
unseen grimaces and stares
among spruce greens
these few forests left
all of us trying to be alone
quiet and blind

i see soldiers in bus stations
with colored names
polaroid shots
their girlfriends chew gum
smile wide

in all this silver of sky
like stars these wheels
car gears lampshades
electrical refuse
zen oiled and greased
the believers now so many
now so tired of the sad songs
the endless yearnings for war
and more and more

dumb cries i sigh
trying to get out of town
i am writing on the wall
it will be painted over
like all the songs
once outside
but as i fly over this time

dianne is dancing
touching the far reaches
leaping and teaching
she strokes and struts the air
none of us stumbles
or fears their lives
steel beams and rail tracks
strike an E-flat B-flat A
E-flat B-flat A
dianne is dancing
no one can handle the hostages
terror is abandoned
because of light
breaking in leaves
because the center is gone
we are still breathing
and the swing is our bodies"
AnonymousAs I was Going to St Ives"As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Each wife had seven sacks
Each sack had seven cats
Each cat had seven kits
Kits cats sacks and wives
How many were there going to St Ives"
J Allyn RosserAs If"How do you explain why elephants
appear to move their unwieldy hulks
with greater dignity than most humans do
in their finest moments
as if they had evolved beyond wanting
anything but what they have
Why does the field begin to ripple
before the wind arrives in whispers
as if there were a communication
as if the landscape were poorly dubbed
and we weren’t expected to notice
What butterfly does not dart away from us
as if it could sense our latent cruelties
and yet return to check and double-check
Has the night not gotten recently darker
as if to insinuate that we have squandered
the light that was there
Have we made too much of our own
And did you notice afterward the dawn
opening up with a tentative eagerness
as if there were something crucial to illumine
as if we would wake up early just to see it
I imagine you reading this now
with an expression of quiet trouble
itself troubled by currents of hope
as if you imagined me here with you
as if I might be able to see your expression
and at least answer it with mine"

A new band our new name was the Abandoned

that
awaited us never not sure we’d get there what
way we were yet to know I stood pat a rickety
sixty-six tapped out a scarecrow jig in waltz

rhapsodize I chided myself who to so mark my-
self chill teeth suddenly forming reforming
who to let my heart out so    To be at odds with

Charles BernsteinAs If the Trees By Their Very Roots Had Hold of Us"Strange to remember a visit really not so
Long ago which now seems finally past Always it’s a
Kind of obvious thing I guess amazed by that
Cycle that first you anticipate a thing amp it seems
Far off the distance has a weight you can feel
Hanging on you amp then it’s there – that
Point – whatever – which now while
It’s happening seems to be constantly slipping away
“Like the sand through your fingers in an old movie” until
You can only look back on it amp yet you’re still there staring
At your thoughts in the window of the fire you find yourself before
We’ve gone over this a thousand times amp here again combing that
Same section of beach or inseam for that – I’m no
Longer sure when or exactly where – “amp yet” the peering
Unrewarding as it isin terms of tangible results
Seems so necessary

Hope which is after all no more than a splint of thought
Projected outwards “looking to catch” some where–
What can I say here – that the ease or
Difficulty of such memories doesn’t preclude
“That harsher necessity” of going on always in
A new place under different circumstances
amp yet we don’t seem to have changed it’s
As if these years that have gone by are
All a matter of record “but if the real
Facts were known” we were still reeling from
What seems to have just happened but which
“By the accountant’s keeping” occurred years
AgoYears ago It hardly seems possible
So little really has happened

We shore ourselves hour by hour
In anticipation that soon there will be
Nothing to do “Pack a sandwich
amp let’s eat later” And of course
The anticipation is quite appropriate accounting
For the most part for whatever activity
We do manage  Eternally buzzing over the time
Unable to live in it…

“Maybe if we go upaways we can get a better
View” But of course in that sense views don’t
Improve “In the present moment” if we could only see
It which is to say to begin with stop looking with
Such anticipation what is enfolding before us puts to
Rest any necessity for “progression”

So more of these tracings as if by some magic
Of the phonetic properties of these squiggles… Or
Does that only mystify the “power” of “presence"" which
Is as well a sort of postponement"
Nicholas FriedmanAs Is"Just north of town a quaint Sargasso Sea
for bric-a-brac the barn itself antique
spills over with a grab-bag panoply
of outworn stock revalued as “unique”
Typewriters tall as headstones fill the loft
where they’ve been ricked away like sacks of grain
a coffer yawns the must of oak—gone soft—
when one man squinting lifts the lid to feign
intrigue Nearby his wife surveys the smalls
art deco bangles bright as harpsichords
a glut of iron trivets Christmas balls
Depression glass and warping Ouija boards

They don’t buy much but that’s not why they came"
Gerard Manley HopkinsAs Kingfishers Catch Fire"As kingfishers catch fire dragonflies draw flame
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells

Deals out that being indoors each one dwells
Selves — goes itselfmyself it speaks and spells
Crying Whát I dó is me for that I came

I say móre the just man justices
Keeps grace thát keeps all his goings graces

Chungmi KimAs My Life is a Dream"I painted a phoenix in bright colors
cut it in nine pieces and cooked it
in a pot at the mountaintop
I stirred it as if cranking reels of
a movie Unraveled were a series
of faces in mosaic

Kurosawa appeared He asked me
what my story was about
Tongue-tied I could not answer
He handed me a token with a silvery
eagle engraved ready to fly

How real I thought everything was
in my dream

In my waking hour I see
the remnant of the war between
my head and heart

Now in cease-fire my chest is filled
with the fresh breeze of serenity
I begin to breathe gently as my story
is unraveled like in a movie

No longer haunted my love of God soars
as I see my guardian angel smile
in the clear blue sky transforming to
one gigantic phoenix

My wandering in the wilderness of
the mind has taught me a little wisdom
I believe my dreams are real
as my life is a dream"
Charles OlsonAs the Dead Prey Upon Us"As the dead prey upon us
they are the dead in ourselves
awake my sleeping ones I cry out to you
disentangle the nets of being

I pushed my car it had been sitting so long unused
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together

as were the dead souls in the living room gathered
about my mother some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector some record
playing on the victrola and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell

I turned to the young man on my right and asked “How is it
there” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask we are poor
poor And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories cardboard
displays the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell poor and doomed
to mere equipments

my mother as alive as ever she was asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp and awaking as I came up to her as she ever had

I found out she returns to the house once a week and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life

O the dead

and the Indian woman and I
enabled the blue deer
to walk

and the blue deer talked
in the next room
a Negro talk

it was like walking a jackass
and its talk
was the pressing gabber of gammers
of old women

and we helped walk it around the room
because it was seeking socks
or shoes for its hooves
now that it was acquiring

human possibilities

In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down

Walk the jackass
Hear the victrola
Let the automobile
be tucked into a corner of the white fence
when it is a white chair Purity

is only an instant of being the trammels

recur

In the five hindrances perfection
is hidden
I shall get
to the place
 minutes late

It will be  minutes
of  And I don’t know

without the car

how I shall get there

O peace my mother I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do

That you are back each week
that you fall asleep
with your face to the right

that you are present there
when I come in as you were
when you were alive

that you are as solid and your flesh
is as I knew it that you have the company
I am used to your having

but o that you all find it
such a cheapness

o peace mother for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life

The nets we are entangled in Awake
my soul let the power into the last wrinkle
of being let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth Let even your mother
go Let there be only paradise

The desperateness is that the instant
which is also paradise paradise
is happiness dissolves
into the next instant and power
flows to meet the next occurrence

Is it any wonder
my mother comes back
Do not that throng
rightly seek the room
where they might expect
happiness They did not complain
of life they obviously wanted
the movie each other merely to pass
among each other there
where the real is even to the display cards
to be out of hell

The poverty
of hell

O souls in life and in death
make even as you sleep even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away clears the sodden weights of goods
equipment entertainment the foods the Indian woman
the filthy blue deer the  by  foot ‘Viewbook’
the heaviness of the old house the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets

and they disappear as ghosts do
as spider webs nothing
before the hand of man

The vent You must have the vent
or you shall die Which means
never to die the ghastliness

of going and forever
coming back returning
to the instants which were not lived

O mother this I could not have done
I could not have lived what you didn’t
I am myself netted in my own being

I want to die I want to make that instant too
perfect

O my soul slip
the cog


II

The death in life death itself
is endless eternity
is the false cause

The knot is other wise each topological corner
presents itself and no sword
cuts it each knot is itself its fire

each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flame

o mother if you had once touched me

o mother if I had once touched you

The car did not burn Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse The old man

merely removed it as I looked up at it
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dog

or a child’s chair

The woman
playing on the grass
with her son the woman next door

was angry with me whatever it was
slipped across the playpen or whatever
she had out there on the grass

And I was quite flip in reply
that anyone who used plastic
had to expect things to skid

and break that I couldn’t worry
that her son might have been hurt
by whatever it was I sent skidding

down on them

It was just then I went into my house
and to my utter astonishment
found my mother sitting there

as she always had sat as must she always
forever sit there her head lolling
into sleep Awake awake my mother

what wind will lift you too
forever from the tawdriness
make you rich as all those souls

crave crave crave

to be rich

They are right We must have
what we want We cannot afford
not to We have only one course

the nets which entangle us are flames

O souls burn
alive burn now

that you may forever
have peace have

what you crave

O souls
go into everything
let not one knot pass
through your fingers

let not any they tell you
you must sleep as the net
comes through your authentic hands

What passes
is what is what shall be what has
been what hell and heaven is
is earth to be rent to shoot you
through the screen of flame which each knot
hides as all knots are a wall ready
to be shot open by you

the nets of being
are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
ought to be busy Method method

I too call on you to come
to the aid of all men to women most
who know most to woman to tell
men to awake Awake men
awake

I ask my mother
to sleep I ask her
to stay in the chair
My chair
is in the corner of the fence
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones The blue deer
need not trouble either of us

And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest The automobile

has been hauled away"
Edward ThomasAs the Teams Head Brass"As the team’s head-brass flashed out on the turn
The lovers disappeared into the wood
I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm
That strewed an angle of the fallow and
Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square
Of charlock Every time the horses turned
Instead of treading me down the ploughman leaned
Upon the handles to say or ask a word
About the weather next about the war
Scraping the share he faced towards the wood
And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed
Once more
The blizzard felled the elm whose crest
I sat in by a woodpecker’s round hole
The ploughman said “When will they take it away”
“When the war’s over” So the talk began—
One minute and an interval of ten
A minute more and the same interval
“Have you been out” “No” “And don’t want
to perhaps”
“If I could only come back again I should
I could spare an arm I shouldn’t want to lose
A leg If I should lose my head why so
I should want nothing more    Have many gone
From here” “Yes” “Many lost” “Yes agood few
Only two teams work on the farm this year
One of my mates is dead The second day
In France they killed him It was back in March
The very night of the blizzard too Now if
He had stayed here we should have moved the tree”
“And I should not have sat here Everything
Would have been different For it would have been
Another world” “Ay and a better though
If we could see all all might seem good” Then
The lovers came out of the wood again
The horses started and for the last time
I watched the clods crumble and topple over
After the ploughshare and the stumbling team"
Kenneth Patchen“As We Are So Wonderfully Done with Each Other”"As we are so wonderfully done with each other
We can walk into our separate sleep
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies

O my lady my fairest dear my sweetest loveliest one
Your lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers
My hands are hallowed where they touched over your
soft curving

It is good to be weary from that brilliant work
It is being God to feel your breathing under me

A waterglass on the bureau fills with morning   
Don’t let anyone in to wake us"
David RoderickAs When Drought Imagines Fire"Loot my point of view
hove my heart
free from its hived booth
though I know your smoke
its black blossom
is a substance I’ll never become
colors
of plaster and grass I’ve prepped
flawlessly rivers I’ve whittled thin

It’s a personal matter to me the wind
But let it be our cathedral feeling
a sculpture
of ash
dragging its robe over
the hills because of us
because of me
Yellow is hurried
but red moves like a swarm
through toothpick homes
pans over roofs
where the ethos we child
from the ground
will blacken to ruin
Let’s glory
this roughened nap
of landscape
this parched Arcadia
with one nude-struck match and a breeze"

Sir Walter RaleghAs You Came from the Holy Land attributed"As you came from the holy land
Of Walsingham
Met you not with my true love
By the way as you came

“How shall I know your true love
That have met many one
I went to the holy land
That have come that have gone”

She is neither white nor brown
But as the heavens fair
There is none hath a form so divine
In the earth or the air

“Such a one did I meet good sir
Such an angelic face
Who like a queen like a nymph did appear
By her gait by her grace”

She hath left me here all alone
All alone as unknown
Who sometimes did me lead with herself
And me loved as her own

“What’s the cause that she leaves you alone
And a new way doth take
Who loved you once as her own
And her joy did you make”

I have lov’d her all my youth
But now old as you see
Love likes not the falling fruit
From the withered tree

Know that Love is a careless child
And forgets promise past
He is blind he is deaf when he list
And in faith never fast

His desire is a dureless content
And a trustless joy
He is won with a world of despair
And is lost with a toy

Of womenkind such indeed is the love
Or the word love abus’d
Under which many childish desires
And conceits are excus’d

But true love is a durable fire
In the mind ever burning
Never sick never old never dead
From itself never turning"

Louis UntermeyerAsh Wednesday"Vienna
I


Shut out the light or let it filter through
These frowning aisles as penitentially
As though it walked in sackcloth Let it be
Laid at the feet of all that ever grew
Twisted and false like this rococo shrine
Where cupids smirk from candy clouds and where
The Lord with polished nails and perfumed hair
Performs a parody of the divine

The candles hiss the organ-pedals storm
Writhing and dark the columns leave the earth
To find a lonelier and darker height
The church grows dingy while the human swarm
Struggles against the impenitent body’s mirth
Ashes to ashes    Go    Shut out the light

Hinterbrühl
II


And so the light runs laughing from the town
Pulling the sun with him along the roads
That shed their muddy rivers as he goads
Each blade of grass the ice had flattened down
At every empty bush he stops to fling
Handfuls of birds with green and yellow throats
While even the hens uncertain of their notes
Stir rusty vowels in attempts to sing

He daubs the chestnut-tips with sudden reds
And throws an olive blush on naked hills
That hoped somehow to keep themselves in white
Who calls for sackcloth now He leaps and spreads
A carnival of color gladly spills
His blood the resurrection—and the light"

Eat I must and sleep I will — and would that night were here
But ah — to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike
Would that it were day again — with twilight near

Love has gone and left me and I dont know what to do
This or that or what you will is all the same to me
But all the things that I begin I leave before Im through —
Theres little use in anything as far as I can see

Love has gone and left me — and the neighbors knock and borrow
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse —
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
Theres this little street and this little house"
Kimiko HahnThe Ashes"When the puppy snarfles for breakfast
I wake to the radiator gurgling
then feet crunching the reticent snow
Before I was born Mother sewed her own suits
What do her ashes know

•

Father shoved snow off the supine roof
Mother crafted Christmas ornaments
glue and glitter and red balls
No tinsel no angels
Her death started in the living room

•

For bonsai pliers the size of a nail clipper
spools of wire and a fist-sized rock
One bore a petite pomegranate
never to eat not to touch
Her death began with a baseball bat

•

In the vineyard he secured the strongest cane
from training stake to fruiting wire
Pruning with handsaw and lopper
He’d leave a spur for the next season
He shoved her away with direct objects

•

In a cold snap if one pipe freezes
the rest may freeze as well
Even before the puppy snarfles
Even before a baby brother arrived
in the misleading car in Mother’s arms

•

After the war after she met Father
she smoked cigarettes but didn’t cha-cha anymore
She’d light up and blow smoke
out the apoplectic window
He found the ashes on the sill

•

Fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside
the savvy window of my own first home
On the stereo a bluesman cried
I need my ashes hauled
The dress was too smart to wear

•

I tucked away our baby’s pink layette
in circumspect mothballs
for a christening that never took place
As well a doll that Auntie crocheted
More than anything I love tidal pools

•

I know her ashes are at Father’s lost
in his charnel of junk mail
He claims that thieves have stolen that box
his knob cutter and root hook
He says remains aren’t ashes anyways

•

Winter stripped everything to the limb
and dejected nest No angels no crèche
I don’t know whose recollections are suspect
after leaving Maui Mother learned to swim
She loved tidal pools more than anything

•

In my kitchen the logs blink in the fire —
through blinds the wind blusters and
the browbeaten trees creak in the orchard
The rain pours then stops for sun If
he lost Mother’s ashes what more could I stand

•

Omusubi tastes best on black beaches
Since Mother never learned to swim
did she watch her five brothers from a blanket
On the intransigent subway I don’t know if
I’ve passed my station His mother said yes—
Iron I bit my lip again

•

Mother showed our baby how to sift flour
and how to crank an eggbeater
After Father lost her
he barred everyone from the rooms and the yard
where at night long red worms
slither up from the ground

•

Her ashes know before the puppy snarfles
Father shoves snow off the supine roof
for bonsai use pliers the size of a nail clipper
in the vineyard the strongest canes
in a cold snap a hair dryer on frozen pipes
fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside
while I tucked away my baby’s pink layette
Her ashes know their box is in the living room
where she didn’t cha-cha anymore
Where has winter stripped everything to the nest
In my kitchen the logs blink in the fire and I know
omusubi tastes best on black beaches
She knew to show her granddaughter how to sift flour"
Karin GottshallThe Ashes"You were carried here by hands
and now the wind has you gritty
as incense dark sparkles borne

in the shape of blowing
this great atmospheric bloom
spinning under the bridge and expanding—

shape of wind and its pattern
of shattering Having sloughed off
the urns temporary shape

there is another of you now—
tell me which to speak to
the one you were or are the one who waited

in the ashes for this scattering or the one
now added to the already haunted woods
the woods that sigh and shift their leaves—

where your mystery billows then breathes"
Paul CelanAshglory"Ashglory behind
your shaken-knotted
hands at the threeway

Pontic erstwhile here

on

the drowned rudder blade
deep
in the petrified oath
it roars up

On the vertical
breathrope in those days
higher than above
between two painknots while
the glossy
Tatarmoon climbed up to us
I dug myself into you and into you

Ash-

The cast-in-front-of-you from

W S MerwinThe Asians Dying"When the forests have been destroyed their darkness remains
The ash the great walker follows the possessors
Forever
Nothing they will come to is real
Nor for long
Over the watercourses
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
Making a new twilight

Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead
Again again with its pointless sound
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything

The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed
The dead go away like bruises
The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands
Pain the horizon
Remains
Overhead the seasons rock
They are paper bells
Calling to nothing living

The possessors move everywhere under Death their star
Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows
Like thin flames with no light
They with no past
And fire their only future"
Karl ShapiroAside"Mail-day and over the world in a thousand drag-nets
The bundles of letters are dumped on the docks and beaches
And all that is dear to the personal conscious reaches
Around us again like filings around iron magnets
And war stands aside for an hour and looks at our faces
Of total absorption that seem to have lost their places

O demobilized for a moment a world is made human
Returns to a time that is neither the present or then
But a garland of clippings and wishes of who-knows-when
A time of its own creation a thing of acumen
That keeps us like movies alive with a purpose aside
From the play-acting truth of the newsreel in which we have died

And aside from the candy and pictures and books we receive
As if we were patients whose speedy recovery were certain
There is proof of the End and the lights and the bow at the curtain
After which we shall smile at each other and get up to leave
Aside from the play in the play there is all that is fact
These letters the battle in progress the place of the act

And the optimal joy of the conflict the tears of the ads
May move us or not and the movies at night in the palms
May recall us or not to the kiss and on Sunday the psalms
May remind us of Sunday or not but aside from the lads
Who arrive like our letters still fresh from the kiss and the tear
There are mouths that are dusty and eyes that are wider than fear

Say no more of the dead than a prayer say no more of the land
Where the body is laid in the coral than that it is far
Take your finger away from the map of wherever-we-are
For we lie in the map of the chart of your elderly hand
Do not hasten the future in agony too there is time
For the growth of the rose of the spirit astir in the slime

For aside from ourselves as we are there is nothing alive
Except as it keeps us alive not tomorrow but now
Our mail-day today of the blood of the sweat of our brow
The year of our war to the end When and where we arrive
Is no matter but
how
is the question we urgently need
How to love and to hate how to die how to write and to read"
Durs GrünbeinAsked what it is"The huge scar-pocked palm leaf
outside the papeterie in Papeete

The bikini billboard at the bus station
of a busy mining town in Bohemia

That moment’s hesitation in the photo studio
how did I come to appear in this light

The philologist’s pink index card his
commentary on a line from the Iliad

Letters that the lazy postman left behind
in a sack labeled “Destination The Azores”

Now it’s turned out different after all so different
from what we imagined in our evening courses

No idea who it is will one day give the speech
to summon up an army of heroes

Fighting machines were the latest hit when
our children’s children still went to the movies

What now How should I pass my days
with the world exposition long since over

Discovered by divers far from the coast
a yellow pianola at the bottom of the sea

The calm of images thick with dreams
in the banana republic of the real

Francisco AragónAsleep You Become a Continent"Francisco X Alarcón
asleep you become a continent—
undiscovered mysterious long
your legs mountain ranges
encircling valleys ravines

night slips past your eyelids
your breath the swaying of the sea
sprawled across the bed like
a dolphin washed ashore your mouth

is the mouth of a sated volcano
O fragrant timber how do you burn
you are so near and yet so far

as you doze like a lily at my side
I undo myself and invoke the moon—
I’m a dog watching over your sleep"

In a package of minutes there is this We
How beautiful
Merry foreigners in our morning
we laugh we touch each other
are responsible props and posts

A physical light is in the room

Because the world is at the window
we cannot wonder very long

You rise Although
genial you are in yourself again
I observe
your direct and respectable stride
You are direct and self-accepting as a lion
in Afrikan velvet You are level lean
remote


There is a moment in Camaraderie
when interruption is not to be understood
I cannot bear an interruption
This is the shining joy
the time of not-to-end

On the street we smile
We go
in different directions
down the imperturbable street"

Let not thine eyes know
Any forbidden thing itself although
It once should save as well as kill but be
Its shadow upon life enough for thee"

Mourn like the lost Water is slate far down
Through sounds of ice cubes dropped in glass an osteopath
Dressed for the links describes an old Intourist tour

Edward ThomasAspens"All day and night save winter every weather
Above the inn the smithy and the shop
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together
Of rain until their last leaves fall from the top

Out of the blacksmiths cavern comes the ringing
Of hammer shoe and anvil out of the inn
The clink the hum the roar the random singing—
The sounds that for these fifty years have been

The whisper of the aspens is not drowned
And over lightless pane and footless road
Empty as sky with every other sound
Not ceasing calls their ghosts from their abode

A silent smithy a silent inn nor fails
In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom
In tempest or the night of nightingales
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room

And it would be the same were no house near
Over all sorts of weather men and times
Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear
But need not listen more than to my rhymes

Whatever wind blows while they and I have leaves
We cannot other than an aspen be
That ceaselessly unreasonably grieves
Or so men think who like a different tree"

Martín EspadaThe Assassination of the Landlord’s Purple Vintage  Monte Carlo"The landlord says we have to go On the night the thermostat read seventeen
below zero and there was no heat on the first floor the Massachusetts State
Sanitary Code appeared in the landlord’s in-box like a spirit tapping bony
knuckles on his window and a letter appeared in the landlord’s in-box
like a spirit scratching the words no rent in the frost on his window
and the landlord’s mouth foamed as if he’d swallowed detergent
and the foam froze on his beard and the landlord’s plumber laid
twenty-four feet of baseboard on the first floor and now we have to go

The landlord keeps his purple vintage  Monte Carlo parked at the edge
of the driveway purple inside and out paint job and upholstery purple
the color of emperors The mad emperor Caligula assassinated his cousin
jealous of his purple cloak and the mad emperor’s mouth foamed
as if he’d swallowed detergent and the foam froze on his beard

The neighbors report a moose sighting today The moose charges from the woods
mad as an emperor jealous of a purple cloak sees the purple vintage
 Monte Carlo as another moose and rams Caligula’s chariot with
his bristling antlers kicking the car the way a teenager high on detergent
T-boned my leased Toyota Corolla two weeks ago and so the moose claims
his territory this land without a gas station or a movie theater or a pizza joint
or a doctor’s office and gallops back into the woods snorting foam

Now come the hunters tracking the moose crossbows bristling since crossbow
season is upon us their vision blurred by a night of Red Bull and detergent
and see the purple vintage  Monte Carlo as a moose firing volley
after volley of arrows into the windshield and the talisman of the air freshener
hanging from the rearview mirror does not keep the glass from exploding
and the jumper cables coiled in the back seat do not rise magically like electric
eels and the hunters explode in a cry of huzzah waving their crossbows
as if their arrows thumped the hump of Richard the hunchback king

The purple vintage  Monte Carlo is a dead moose tow truck dragging
away the carcass to a round of applause in my brain The landlord will snort
and foam demanding to know why there is nothing left but his mutilated
vanity plate stamped with the year  and I will speak to him in Brooklynese
palms turned upward in the universal gesture of the uncooperative witness
He will keep my security deposit his territory without a gas station
or a movie theater or a pizza joint or a doctor’s office I say huzzah"
Raymond McDanielAssault to Abjury"Rain commenced and wind did

A crippled ship slid ashore

Our swimmer’s limbs went heavy

The sand had been flattened

The primary dune the secondary dune both leveled

The maritime forest extracted

Every yard of the shore was shocked with jellyfish

The blue pillow of the man o’ war empty in the afterlight

The threads of the jellyfish spent

Disaster weirdly neatened the beach

We cultivated the debris field

Castaway trash our treasure

Jewel box spoon ring sack of rock candy

A bicycle exoskeleton without wheels grasshopper green

Our dead ten speed

We rested in red mangrove and sheltered in sheets

Our bruises blushed backwards our blisters did

is it true is it true

God help us we tried to stay shattered but we just got better

We grew adept we caught the fish as they fled

We skinned the fish our knife clicked like an edict

We were harmed and then we healed"
Paisley Rekdal"Assemblage of Ruined Plane Parts Vietnam Military Museum Hanoi""My eye climbs a row of spoilers soldered
into ailerons cracked bay doors haphazarded
into windows where every rivet bleeds
contrails of rust An hour ago the doctor’s wand
waved across my chest and I watched blood
on a small screen get back-sucked
into my weakened heart It’s grown a hole
I have to monitor one torn flap
shuddering an infinite ellipsis of gray stars
back and forthYou’re the writer the doctor said
in FrenchTell me what you see Easier to stand
in a courtyard full of tourists scrying shapes
from this titanic Rorschach Here’s a pump stub
shaped like a hand something celled
cavernously fluted as a lobster’s
abdomen How much work
it must have taken to drag these bits
out of pits of flame from lake beds
and rice paddies and stack them in layers
the French planes heaped beneath
the American ones while the Englishwoman
beside me peers into this mess
of metals trying to isolate one image
from the rest Ski boot buckle
or tire pump she muses at me fossilized
shark’s jaw clothespin wasp’s nest
According to the camera it’s just a picture
changing with each angle relic
turned to rib cage chrome flesh
to animal all the mortal details
enumerated neutered I watch her trace
an aluminum sheet torched across a thruster
as if wind had tossed a silk scarf
over a face If she pulled it back would I find
a body foreign as my own entombed
in here a thousand dog tags
jangling in the dark I tilt my head the vision slides
once more past me each plane reassembling
then breaking apart Spikes of grief—
or is it fury—throb across the surface
Everything has a rip in it a hole a tear the dim sounds
of something struggling to pry open
death’s cracked fuselage White sparks
iron trails My heart rustles
in its manila folder How the doctor smiled
at the images I fed himA row of trees I said
pointing at my chartStone towers
a flock of backlit swallows—
Now I kneel beside a cross
of blades on which the Englishwoman
tries to focusDo you think I’ll get it
all in the shot she calls as she steps back
Steps back and back Something like a knife sheath
Something like a saint’s skull The sky
floats past horizon sucked into it She won’t"
Camille T DungyAssociation Copy"Lynda Hull
Maybe you sold it to buy junk Though I like to think not
And I dont want to think you used the money for food

or rent or anything obligatory practical

A pair of boots perhaps Thigh high burgandy boots
with gold laces Something crucial as lilies
Mostly I want to believe you held onto the book
that your fingers brailed those pages inky veins
even in your final weeks I want to believe
words can be that important in the end

Who can help the heart which is grand and full
of gestures I had been on my way out
He was rearranging his bookshelves
when in an approximation of tenderness
he handed me like the last of the sweet potatoes
at Thanksgiving like a thing he wanted
but was willing to share the rediscovered book—
hed bought it years ago in a used bookstore
in Chicago Levines poems with your signature inside

That whole year I spent loving him something splendid
as lemons sour and bright and leading my tongue
toward new language was on the shelf These
werent your own poems autographed a strangers
souvenir—wed spent vain months leafing through
New York stacks for your out-of-print collections—but youd cared
about this book or cared enough to claim it your name
looped across the title page as if to sayPlease
This is mine This book is mine Though you sold it
Or someone else did when you died

We make habits out of words I grew accustomed
to his the way they spooned me into sleep
so many times Now I am sleepless and alone
another night What would you give for one more night
alone No booze No drugs Just that hunger
and those words He gave me The Names of the Lost
Need comes down hard on a body What else
was sold What else—do you know—did we lose"
Carl RakosiAssociations with a View from the House"What can be compared to
the living eye
Its East
is flowering
honeysuckle
and its North
dogwood bushes

What can be compared
to light
in which leaves darken
after rain
fierce green
like Rousseau’s jungle
any minute
the tiger head
will poke through
the foliage
peering
at experience

Who is like man
sitting in the cell
of referents
whose eye
has never seen
a jungle
yet looks in

It is the great eye
source of security
Praised be thou
as the Jews say
who have engraved
clarity
and delivered us
to the mind
where you must reign
severe
as quiddity of bone
forever
and ever without
bias or mercy
attrition or mystery"
Gottfried BennAsters"Asters—sweltering days
old adjuration/curse
the gods hold the balance
for an uncertain hour

Once more the golden flocks
of heaven the light the trim—
what is the ancient process
hatching under its dying wings

Once more the yearned-for
the intoxication the rose of you—
summer leaned in the doorway
watching the swallows—

one more presentiment
where certainty is not hard to come by
wing tips brush the face of the waters
swallows sip speed and night"
Rachel RichardsonAstronomer"A child climbs into a cardboard house
shuts its doors and windows
to hold in the dark and lies on her back
inside looking up through its cut-out moon
and stars She knows she is not looking
at the sky But she calls out still
Its nighttime Im looking at the sky"
Kahlil GibranThe Astronomer"In the shadow of the temple my friend and I saw a blind man sittingalone And my friend said “Behold the wisest man of our land”

Then I left my friend and approached the blind man and greeted himAnd we conversed

After a while I said “Forgive my question but since when has thoubeen blind”

“From my birth” he answered

Said I “And what path of wisdom followest thou”

Said he “I am an astronomer”

Then he placed his hand upon his breast saying “I watch all thesesuns and moons and stars”"
Alan R ShapiroAstronomy Lesson"The two boys lean out on the railing
of the front porch looking up
Behind them they can hear their mother
in one room watching “Name That Tune”
their father in another watching
a Walter Cronkite Special the TVs
turned up high and higher till they
each can’t hear the other’s show
The older boy is saying that no matter
how many stars you counted there were
always more stars beyond them
and beyond the stars black space
going on forever in all directions
so that even if you flew up
millions and millions of years
you’d be no closer to the end
of it than they were now
here on the porch on Tuesday night
in the middle of summer
The younger boy can think somehow
only of his mother’s closet
how he likes to crawl in back
behind the heavy drapery
of shirts nightgowns and dresses
into the sheer black where
no matter how close he holds
his hand up to his face
there’s no hand ever no
face to hold it to

A woman from another street
is calling to her stray cat or dog
clapping and whistling it in
and farther away deep in the city
sirens now and again
veer in and out of hearing

The boys edge closer shoulder
to shoulder now sad Ptolemies
the older looking up the younger
as he thinks back straight ahead
into the black leaves of the maple
where the street lights flicker
like another watery skein of stars
“Name That Tune” and Walter Cronkite
struggle like rough water
to rise above each other
And the woman now comes walking
in a nightgown down the middle
of the street clapping and
whistling while the older boy
goes on about what light years
are and solar winds black holes
and how the sun is cooling
and what will happen to
them all when it is cold"

   Loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show""Loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show
That she dear she might take some pleasure of my pain—
Pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know
Knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain—
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe
Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain
Oft turning others leaves to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnd brain
But words came halting forth wanting inventions stay
Invention Natures child fled step-dame Studys blows
And others feet still seemd but strangers in my way
Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes
Biting my truant pen beating myself for spite
""Fool"" said my Muse to me ""look in thy heart and write"""
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella  Stella is sick and in that sick-bed lies""Stella is sick and in that sick-bed lies
Sweetness that breathes and pants as oft as she
And grace sick too such fine conclusions tries
That sickness brags itself best graced to be
Beauty is sick but sick in so fair guise
That in that paleness beauty’s white we see
And joy which is inseparate from these eyes
Stella now learns strange case to weep in thee
Love moves thy pain and like a faithful page
As thy looks stir runs up and down to make
All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage
Nature with care sweats for her darling’s sake
Knowing worlds pass ere she enough can find
Of such heaven stuff to clothe so heavenly mind"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella  Where be the roses gone which sweetened so our eyes""Where be the roses gone which sweetened so our eyes
Where those red cheeks which oft with fair increase did frame
The height of honor in the kindly badge of shame
Who hath the crimson weeds stolen from my morning skies
How doth the color vade of those vermilion dyes
Which Natures self did make and self engrained the same
I would know by what right this paleness overcame
That hue whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties
Galens adoptive sons who by a beaten way
Their judgements hackney on the fault on sickness lay
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far
It is but love which makes his paper perfect white
To write therein more fresh the story of delight
Whiles beautys reddest ink Venus for him doth stir"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella  O absent presence Stella is not here""O absent presence Stella is not here
False flattering hope that with so fair a face
Bare me in hand that in this orphan place
Stella I say my Stella should appear
What say’st thou now Where is that dainty cheer
Thou told’st mine eyes should help their famished case
But thou art gone now that self-felt disgrace
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near
But here I do store of fair ladies meet
Who may with charm of conversation sweet
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow
Sure they prevail as much with me as he
That bade his friend but then new maimed to be
Merry with him and not think of his woe"

Of all the powers which life bestows on me
There ere by them aught undertaken be
They first resort unto that sovereign part
Sweet for a while give respite to my heart
Which pants as though it still should leap to thee
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy
To this great cause which needs both use and art
And as a queen who from her presence sends
Whom she employs dismiss from thee my wit
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends
On servants’ shame oft master’s blame doth sit
Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove
And scorning say “See what it is to love”"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   Alas have I not pain enough my friend""Alas have I not pain enough my friend
Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire
Than did on him who first stale down the fire
While Love on me doth all his quiver spend
But with your rhubarb words you must contend
To grieve me worse in saying that Desire
Doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire
Of sinful thoughts which do in ruin end
If that be sin which doth the manners frame
Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed
Ready of wit and fearing naught but shame
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed
A loathing of all loose unchastity
Then love is sin and let me sinful be"

   You that do search for every purling spring""You that do search for every purling spring
Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows
And every flower not sweet perhaps which grows
Near thereabouts into your poesy wring
Ye that do dictionarys method bring
Into your rimes running in rattling rows
You that poor Petrarchs long-deceased woes
With new-born sighs and denizend wit do sing
You take wrong ways those far-fet helps be such
As do bewray a want of inward touch
And sure at length stoln goods do come to light
But if both for your love and skill your name
You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame
Stella behold and then begin to endite"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella  Not at first sight nor with a dribbèd shot""Not at first sight nor with a dribbèd shot
Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed
But known worth did in mine of time proceed
Till by degrees it had full conquest got
I saw and liked I liked but lovèd not
I loved but straight did not what love decreed
At length to love’s decrees I forced agreed
Yet with repining at so partial lot
Now even that footstep of lost liberty
Is gone and now like slave-born Muscovite
I call it praise to suffer tyranny
And now employ the remnant of my wit
To make myself believe that all is well
While with a feeling skill I paint my hell"

See there that boy that murdring boy I say
Who like a thief hid in dark bush doth lie
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy
Nor so fair level in so secret stay
As that sweet black which veils the heavnly eye
There himself with his shot he close doth lay
Poor passenger pass now thereby I did
And stayd pleasd with the prospect of the place
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace
And then descried the glistring of his dart
But ere I could fly thence it piercd my heart"

   Your words my friend right healthful caustics blame""Your words my friend right healthful caustics blame
My young mind marred whom Love doth windlass so
That mine own writings like bad servants show
My wits quick in vain thoughts in virtue lame
That Plato I read for nought but if he tame
Such coltish gyres that to my birth I owe
Nobler desires least else that friendly foe
Great expectation wear a train of shame
For since mad March great promise made of me
If now the May of my years much decline
What can be hoped my harvest time will be
Sure you say well your wisdom’s golden mine
Dig deep with learning’s spade now tell me this
Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is"

   The curious wits seeing dull pensiveness""The curious wits seeing dull pensiveness
Bewray itself in my long-settld eyes
Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise
With idle pains and missing aim do guess
Some that know how my spring I did address
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies
Others because the prince my service tries
Think that I think state errors to redress
But harder judges judge ambitions ragei
Scourge of itself still climbing slippry placei
Holds my young brain captivd in golden cage
O fool or over-wise alas the race
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start
But only Stellas eyes and Stellas heart"

   The wisest scholar of the wight most wise""The wisest scholar of the wight most wise
By Phoebus’ doom with sugared sentence says
That Virtue if it once met with our eyes
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise
But for that man with pain this truth descries
While he each thing in sense’s balance weighs
And so nor will nor can behold those skies
Which inward sun to heroic mind displays
Virtue of late with virtuous care to stir
Love of herself takes Stella’s shape that she
To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her
It is most true for since I her did see
Virtue’s great beauty in that face I prove
And find th’effect for I do burn in love"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine""Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine
That bravely maskd their fancies may be told
Or Pindars apes flaunt they in phrases fine
Enamling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold
Or else let them in statelier glory shine
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old
Or with strange similes enrich each line
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold
For me in sooth no Muse but one I know
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites
How then even thus in Stellas face I read
What love and beauty be then all my deed
But copying is what in her Nature writes"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   With how sad steps O Moon thou climbst the skies""With how sad steps O Moon thou climbst the skies
How silently and with how wan a face
What may it be that even in heavnly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries
Sure if that long-with love-acquainted eyes
Can judge of love thou feelst a lovers case
I read it in thy looks thy languishd grace
To me that feel the like thy state descries
Then evn of fellowship O Moon tell me
Is constant love deemd there but want of wit
Are beauties there as proud as here they be
Do they above love to be lovd and yet
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness"

   I might—unhappy word—O me I might""I might—unhappy word—O me I might
And then would not or could not see my bliss
Till now wrapt in a most infernal night
I find how heavnly day wretch I did miss
Heart rend thyself thou dost thyself but right
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his
No force no fraud robbd thee of thy delight
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is
But to myself myself did give the blow
While too much wit forsooth so troubled me
That I respects for both our sakes must show
And yet could not by rising morn foresee
How fair a day was near O punishd eyes
That I had been more foolish—or more wise"

The baiting-place of wit the balm of woe
The poor mans wealth the prisoners release
Th indifferent judge between the high and low
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw
O make in me those civil wars to cease
I will good tribute pay if thou do so
Take thou of me smooth pillows sweetest bed
A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light
A rosy garland and a weary head
And if these things as being thine by right
Move not thy heavy grace thou shalt in me
Livelier than elsewhere Stellas image see"

Guided so well that I obtaind the prize
Both by the judgment of the English eyes
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance
Town folks my strength a daintier judge applies
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance
Others because of both sides I do take
My blood from them who did excel in this
Think Nature me a man of arms did make
How far they shot awry The true cause is
Stella lookd on and from her heavnly face
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   What have I thus betrayed my liberty""What have I thus betrayed my liberty
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave
In my free side or am I born a slave
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny
Or want I sense to feel my misery
Or sprite disdain of such disdain to have
Who for long faith though daily help I crave
May get no alms but scorn of beggary
Virtue awake Beauty but beauty is
I may I must I can I will I do
Leave following that which it is gain to miss
Let her go Soft but here she comes Go to
Unkind I love you not O me that eye
Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie"

   Soul’s joy bend not those morning stars from me""Soul’s joy bend not those morning stars from me
Where virtue is made strong by beauty’s might
Where love is chasteness pain doth learn delight
And humbleness grows one with majesty
Whatever may ensue O let me be
Co-partner of the riches of that sight
Let not mine eyes be hell-driv’n from that light
O look O shine O let me die and see
For though I oft my self of them bemoan
That through my heart their beamy darts be gone
Whose cureless wounds even now most freshly bleed
Yet since my death wound is already got
Dear killer spare not they sweet cruel shot
A kind of grace it is to slay with speed"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   I on my horse and Love on me doth try""I on my horse and Love on me doth try
Our horsemanships while by strange work I prove
A horseman to my horse a horse to Love
And now man’s wrongs in me poor beast descry
The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie
Are humbled thoughts which bit of reverence move
Curbed in with fear but with gilt boss above
Of hope which makes it seem fair to the eye
The wand is will thou fancy saddle art
Girt fast by memory and while I spur
My horse he spurs with sharp desire to my heart
He sits me fast however I do stir
And now hath made me to his hand so right
That in the manage myself takes delight"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella  It is most true that eyes are formed to serve""It is most true that eyes are formed to serve
The inward light and that the heavenly part
Ought to be king from whose rules who do swerve
Rebels to Nature strive for their own smart
It is most true what we call Cupid’s dart
An image is which for ourselves we carve
And fools adore in temple of our heart
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve
True that true beauty virtue is indeed
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade
Which elements with mortal mixture breed
True that on earth we are but pilgrims made
And should in soul up to our country move
True and yet true that I must Stella love"
Sir Philip Sidney"Astrophil and Stella 
  
   A strife is grown between Virtue and Love""A strife is grown between Virtue and Love
While each pretends that Stella must be his
Her eyes her lips her all saith Love do this
Since they do wear his badge most firmly prove
But Virtue thus that title doth disprove
That Stella O dear name that Stella is
That virtuous soul sure heir of heav’nly bliss
Not this fair outside which our hearts doth move
And therefore though her beauty and her grace
Be Love’s indeed in Stella’s self he may
By no pretense claim any manner place
Well Love since this demur our suit doth stay
Let Virtue have that Stellas self yet thus
Let Virtue but that body grant to us"

Let folk oerchargd with brain against me cry
Let clouds bedim my face break in mine eye
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case

   When Nature made her chief work Stellas eyes""When Nature made her chief work Stellas eyes
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright
Would she in beamy black like painter wise
Frame daintiest lustre mixd of shades and light
Or did she else that sober hue devise
In object best to knit and strength our sight
Lest if no veil these brave gleams did disguise
They sunlike should more dazzle than delight
Or would she her miraculous power show
That whereas black seems beautys contrary
She even in black doth make all beauties flow
Both so and thussheminding Love should be
Placd ever there gave him this mourning weed
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed"

There shall he find all vices overthrow
Not by rude force but sweetest sovereignty
Of reason from whose light those night-birds fly
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so
And not content to be perfections heir
Thyself dost strive all minds that way to move
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair
So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good

And oft so clings to my pure Love that I
One from the other scarcely can descry
While each doth blow the fire of my heart
Now from thy fellowship I needs must part
Venus is taught with Dian’s wings to fly
I must no more in thy sweet passions lie
Virtue’s gold now must head my Cupid’s dart
Service and honor wonder with delight
Fear to offend will worthy to appear
Care shining in mine eyes faith in my sprite
These things are let me by my only dear

Now banished art But yet alas how shall"

Now blessed you bear onward blessed me
To her where I my heart safe-left shall meet
My Muse and I must you of duty greet
With thanks and wishes wishing thankfully

Nor so ambitious am I as to frame
A nest for my young praise in laurel tree
In truth I sweare I wish not there should be
Graved in mine epitaph a Poet’s name
Nay if I would could I just title make
That any laud to me thereof should grow
Without my plumes from others’ wings I take
For nothing from my wit or will doth flow
Since all my words thy beauty doth endite
And love doth hold my hand and makes me write"

When I demand of Phoenix Stellas state
You say forsooth you left her well of late
O God think you that satisfies my care
I would know whether she did sit or walk
How clothd how waited on sighd she or smild
Whereof with whom how often did she talk
With what pastime times journey she beguiled
If her lips deignd to sweeten my poor name
Say all and all well said still say the same"

You say the old masters never got it wrong
But when Goya painted the death of the imagination
It was a lost dog against a usurious yellow sky
And the dog a hapless creature who had drawn itself
Ten miles on two legs stared in amazement
To see the man who once fed him from his plate
Reduced to this

So I felt this week the vile soil and everything upon it—
The beggar guest kicked from the table
Before his own dog and even the honest unpicking
Of art performed nightly and in seclusion
Like any Penelope my armor is resignation
Although I thought I would lift the bow myself
And draw

By the morning he is gone
And what to make of this
The prostitutes hang from a beam like mice
The suitors are piled unburied in the yard
And some say that it is now much better
And others that it is worse
So order was restored
I stared in amazement

•

Perhaps Akhmatova was right
When she wrote who knows what shit
What tip what pile of waste
Brings forth the tender verse
Like hogweed like the fat hen under the fence
Like the unbearable present tense
Who knows what ill what strife
What crude shack of a life
And how it twists sweetly about the broken sill
Pressingness another word for honeysuckle
But housewives Has poetry
Ever deepened in the pail
Was it ever found in the sink under the table
Did it rise in the oven quietly able
To outhowl the hoover
Does it press more than the children’s supper
The sudden sleepless wail
Did it ever
It lives It takes seed
Like the most unforgiving weed
Grows wilder as the child grows older
And spits on dreams did I say
How it thrives in the ashen family nest
Or how iambs are measured best
Where it hurts
With the heel of an iron
On the reluctant breast
Of a shirt

MICHAEL BLANN


There was a hush then Michael Blann
Stepped out onto the stage Michael
Blann with his pipe and his jukebox head
Oh he’s your man

He has a song for all weathers a pipe
And a voice and he sings and he roams
He sings to the wind and a dog of how
The trees are all bare and Jack’s come home

He’s a thin voice like a spider thread
On days when the sun is late and fine
Live and let live sings Michael Blann
The wind yields not but the hills is mine

He’s no call for fate passing over
His sheep are all angels the stars are his Lords
He’ll play any part the clouds should fancy
To humble tunes and hand-me-down words

The acts are written in briar strands
And the Pharisees are leaves in the air
I likes a drop pipes Michael Blann
Sing follow hark forward the innocent hare

He wore to his end a clutch of sheep’s wool
To show the gods that Michael Blann
Went alone alone for most of his years
But crossed the hills a singing man"

I’m positive you aren’t thinking about me which is fine as long as you
aren’t thinking about yourself I know and love the way you inhabit

Deborah CumminsAt a Certain Age"He sits beside his wife who takes the wheel
Clutching coupons he wanders the aisles
of Stop amp Save There’s no place he must be
no clock to punch Sure
there are bass in the lake a balsa model
in the garage the par-three back nine
But it’s not the same
Time the enemy then the enemy now

As he points the remote at the screen
or pauses at the window staring
into the neighbor’s fence but not really seeing it
he listens to his wife in the kitchen more amazed
than ever—how women seem to know
what to do How with their cycles and timers
their rolling boils and three-minute eggs
they wait for something to start Or stop"
Peter OresickAt a Jewish Cemetery in Pittsburgh"Someone is looking for us
I sensed it earlier at the creek
while floating on my back and again
on Route  near Brookline
So we’ve detoured to this hillside
eroding and crazy with markers
We’re looking for row mm or nn
or something like that
I lug the baby my wife runs ahead
This neighborhood knows her–
she passes so easily between stones
She finds the grave her father
dead ten years now In the time it takes
to say kaddish the sun’s dropped
I set down my son
and he crawls in the dimness
pulling himself up on the headstone
How delicately he fingers the marble
Quickly he rounds its corner Vanishes
I’m thinkinggrass stone quiet–
then babbling from another world"
John MiltonAt a Solemn Music"Blest pair of Sirens pledges of Heavns joy
Sphear-born harmonious Sisters Voice and Vers
Wed your divine sounds and mixt power employ
Dead things with inbreathd sense able to pierce
And to our high-raisd phantasie present
That undisturbèd Song of pure content
Ay sung before the saphire-colourd throne
To him that sits theron
With Saintly shout and solemn Jubily
Where the bright Seraphim in burning row
Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow
And the Cherubick host in thousand quires
Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires
With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms
Hymns devout and holy Psalms
Singing everlastingly
That we on Earth with undiscording voice
May rightly answer that melodious noise
As once we did till disproportiond sin
Jarrd against natures chime and with harsh din
Broke the fair musick that all creatures made
To their great Lord whose love their motion sway’d
In perfect Diapason whilst they stood
In first obedience and their state of good
O may we soon again renew that Song
And keep in tune with Heavn till God ere long
To his celestial consort us unite
To live with him and sing in endles morn of light"

  At a Vacation Exercise""Hail native language that by sinews weak
Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak
And madst imperfect words with childish trips
Half unpronouncd slide through my infant lips
Driving dumb Silence from the portal door
Where he had mutely sate two years before
Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask
That now I use thee in my latter task
Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee
I know my tongue but little grace can do thee
Thou needst not be ambitious to be first
Believe me I have thither packd the worst
And if it happen as I did forecast
The daintest dishes shall be servd up last
I pray thee then deny me not thy aid
For this same small neglect that I have made
But haste thee straight to do me once a pleasure
And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure
Not those new-fangled toys and trimming slight
Which takes our late fantastics with delight
But cull those richest robes and gayst attire
Which deepest spirits and choicest wits desire
I have some naked thoughts that rove about
And loudly knock to have their passage out
And weary of their place do only stay
Till thou hast deckd them in thy best array
That so they may without suspect or fears
Fly swiftly to this fair assemblys ears
Yet I had rather if I were to choose
Thy service in some graver subject use
Such as may make thee search thy coffers round
Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound
Such where the deep transported mind may soar
Above the wheeling poles and at heavns door
Look in and see each blissful deity
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie
Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings
To thtouch of golden wires while Hebe brings
Immortal nectar to her kingly sire
Then passing through the spheres of watchful fire
And misty regions of wide air next under
And hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder
May tell at length how green-eyd Neptune raves
In heavns defiance mustering all his waves
Then sing of secret things that came to pass
When beldam Nature in her cradle was
And last of kings and queens and heroes old
Such as the wise Demodocus once told
In solemn songs at king Alcinous feast
While sad Ulysses soul and all the rest
Are held with his melodious harmony
In willing chains and sweet captivity"
Carl SandburgAt a Window"Give me hunger
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders
Give me hunger pain and want
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame
Give me your shabbiest weariest hunger

But leave me a little love
A voice to speak to me in the day end
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset
One little wandering western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow
Let me go to the window
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love"
Janet Loxley LewisAt Carmel Highlands"Below the gardens and the darkening pines
The living water sinks among the stones
Sinking yet foaming till the snowy tones
Merge with the fog drawn landward in dim lines
The cloud dissolves among the flowering vines
And now the definite mountain-side disowns
The fluid world the immeasurable zones
Then white oblivion swallows all designs

But still the rich confusion of the sea
Unceasing voice sombre and solacing
Rises through veils of silence past the trees
In restless repetition bound yet free
Wave after wave in deluge fresh releasing
An ancient speech hushed in tremendous ease"
Katy DiddenAt Chartres"Who wielded the chisel
at the left portal
south porch the scene

of Theo chained
naked to the waist leaning in
to the brutal hand

of what looks to be
an even younger boy
What man carved stone

to mimic flesh
as it would look inside
the torture of its flensing

How he must have held
the scene in his own
mind thought it back

to the act itself
modeling the lines
with his own limbs

so he would know
both how a body
bends in pain and how

a hand extends the flayer’s rake"
Samuel MenasheAt Cross Purposes"

Is this writing mine
Whose name is this
Did I underline
What I was to miss



An upheaval of leaves
Enlightens the tree
Rooted it receives
Gusts on a spree



Beauty makes me sad
Makes me grieve
I see what I must leave



Scaffold gallows
Do whose will
Who hallows wood
To build kill



Blind man anvil
No hammer strikes
Your eyes are spikes"
James L DickeyAt Darien Bridge"The sea here used to look
As if many convicts had built it

Standing deep in their ankle chains
Ankle-deep in the water to smite

The land and break it down to salt
I was in this bog as a child

When they were all working all day
To drive the pilings down

I thought I saw the still sun
Strike the side of a hammer in flight

And from it a sea bird be born
To take off over the marshes

As the gray climbs the side of my head
And cuts my brain off from the world

I walk and wish mainly for birds
For the one bird no one has looked for

To spring again from a flash
Of metal perhaps from the scratched

Wedding band on my ring finger
Recalling the chains of their feet

I stand and look out over grasses
At the bridge they built long abandoned

Breaking down into water at last
And long like them for freedom

Or death or to believe again
That they worked on the ocean to give it

The unchanging hopeless look
Out of which all miracles leap"
Alfred NoyesAt Dawn"O Hesper-Phosphor far away
Shining the first the last white star
Hear’st thou the strange the ghostly cry
That moan of an ancient agony
From purple forest to golden sky
Shivering over the breathless bay
It is not the wind that wakes with the day
For see the gulls that wheel and call
Beyond the tumbling white-topped bar
Catching the sun-dawn on their wings
Like snow-flakes or like rose-leaves fall
Flutter and fall in airy rings
And drift like lilies ruffling into blossom
Upon a golden lake’s unwrinkled bosom

Are not the forest’s deep-lashed fringes wet
With tears Is not the voice of all regret
Breaking out of the dark earth’s heart
She too she too has loved and lost and we—
We that remember our lost Arcady
Have we not known we too
The primal greenwood’s arch of blue
The radiant clouds at sunrise curled
Around the brows of the golden world
The marble temples washed with dew
To which with rosy limbs aflame
The violet-eyed Thalassian came
Came pitiless only to display
How soon the youthful splendour dies away
Came only to depart
Laughing across the gray-grown bitter sea
For each man’s life is earth’s epitome
And though the years bring more than aught they take
Yet might his heart and hers well break
Remembering how one prayer must still be vain
How one fair hope is dead
One passion quenched one glory fled
With those first loves that never come again

How many how many generations
Have heard that sigh in the dawn
When the dark earth yearns to the unforgotten nations
And the old loves withdrawn
Old loves old lovers wonderful and unnumbered
As waves on the wine-dark sea
’Neath the tall white towers of Troy and the temples that slumbered
In Thessaly

From the beautiful palaces from the miraculous portals
The swift white feet are flown
They were taintless of dust the proud the peerless Immortals
As they sped to their loftier throne
Perchance they are there earth dreams on the shores of Hesper
Her rosy-bosomed Hours
Listening the wild fresh forest’s enchanted whisper
Crowned with its new strange flowers
Listening the great new ocean’s triumphant thunder
On the stainless unknown shore
While that perilous queen of the world’s delight and wonder
Comes white from the foam once more

When the mists divide with the dawn o’er those glittering waters
Do they gaze over unoared seas—
Naiad and nymph and the woodland’s rose-crowned daughters
And the Oceanides
Do they sing together perchance in that diamond splendour
That world of dawn and dew
With eyelids twitching to tears and with eyes grown tender
The sweet old songs they knew
The songs of Greece Ah with harp-strings mute do they falter
As the earth like a small star pales
When the heroes launch their ship by the smoking altar
Does a memory lure their sails
Far far away do their hearts resume the story
That never on earth was told
When all those urgent oars on the waste of glory
Cast up its gold

Are not the forest fringes wet
With tears Is not the voice of all regret
Breaking out of the dark earth’s heart
She too she too has loved and lost and though
She turned last night in disdain
Away from the sunset-embers
From her soul she can never depart
She can never depart from her pain
Vainly she strives to forget
Beautiful in her woe
She awakes in the dawn and remembers"
James K BaxterAt Days Bay"To lie on a beach after
looking at old poems how
slow untroubled by any
grouch of mine or yours Father
Ocean tumbles in the bay
alike with solitary

divers cripples yelling girls
and pipestem kids He does what
suits us all and somewhere — there
out there where the high tight sails
are going — he wears a white
death flag of foam for us far

out for when we want it So
on Gea’s breast the broad nurse
who bears with me I think of
adolescence that sad boy
I was thoughts crusted with ice
on the treadmill of self-love

Narcissus damned who yet brought
like a coal in a hallow
stalk the seed of fire that runs
through my veins now I praise that
sad boy now who having no
hope did not blow out his brains"

Are you origami A paper folded swan

When you saw the constellations lying
on your back in the wet grass
the soapy pear blossoms drifting
and wasting and those stars the burned out ones
whose light was still coming in waves

How could it hold such mass
Still on your lips the taste of something

All night you waited for morning all morning
for afternoon all afternoon for night

Lynn PedersenAt Forty"Pattern or absence of pattern the way a jet flies
into blankness
yet leaves a clear trail I expect time
to reveal an underdrawing
hatching of shadows some rough plan
visible through another spectrum of light

Once at an ophthalmologist’s office
through an accident of mirrors I saw the interior
of my own eye the retina’s
veins like roots or a web and then again

ten years later this time in an astronomy
book—galaxies clusters of galaxies superclusters
of galaxies strung out
strands of a cosmic web the redness
of that image the light extending like roots
 billion years in every direction

Michelangelo could see a figure
in a block of stone waiting to be freed
I want his vision when I look in a mirror
his mathematical principles for depicting space
his ability to translate three dimensions into stone
First I’m in two dimensions a photograph
glued to the glass then three—I’m somewhere between
the glass and the background All my houses friends
come and gone How would he sculpt me How far out
of the stone have I come"
Sarah Orne JewettAt Home from Church"The lilacs lift in generous bloom
Their plumes of dear old-fashioned flowers
Their fragrance fills the still old house
Where left alone I count the hours

High in the apple-trees the bees
Are humming busy in the sun—
An idle robin cries for rain
But once or twice and then is done

The Sunday-morning quiet holds
In heavy slumber all the street
While from the church just out of sight
Behind the elms comes slow and sweet

The organ’s drone the voices faint
That sing the quaint long-meter hymn—
I somehow feel as if shut out
From some mysterious temple dim

And beautiful with blue and red
And golden lights from windows high
Where angels in the shadows stand
And earth seems very near the sky

The day-dream fades—and so I try
Again to catch the tune that brings
No thought of temple nor of priest
But only of a voice that sings"
Gabrielle CalvocoressiAt Last the New Arriving"Like the horn you played in Catholic school
the city will open its mouth and cry

outDont worry bout nothing Dont mean

as a fighter with his eyes swelled shut

It will feel better than any floor
thats risen up to meet you It will rise

like Easter bread golden and familiar
in your grandmothers hands Shell come back

heaven having been too far from home
to hold her O it will be beautiful

Every girl will ask you to dance and the boys
wont kill you for it Shake your head

Dance until your bones clatter What a prize

Rebecca Hazelton"At last to be identified""A dirigible powered us through the first leg
traversing snow-capped mountains where goats
leapt from crags and men with wrinkled

touched your lips in the night

On our pleasant soap
bubble journey we dropped baskets down
each morning hooked meats cheeses
in later weeks nothing Still we took notes

detailing the weather conditions the migrating
elk numbers and their steady decrease
Northward by cracked compass
the sleet sheeting the balloon drove us low then lower—

In time we cut through the ice sank
fathoms into the sea chaperoned by seals
that are not mermaids at all

Anne BoyerAt Least Two Types of People"There are at least two types of people the first for whom the ordinary
worldliness is easy The regular social routines and material cares are
nothing too external to them and easily absorbed They are not alien from
the creation and maintenance of the world and the world does not treat
them as alien And also from them the efforts toward the world and to
them the fulfillment of the worlds moderate desires flow They are ef-
fortless at eating moving arranging their arms as they sit or stand being
hired being paid cleaning up spending playing mating They are in an
ease and comfort The world is for the world and for them

Then there are those over whom the events and opportunities of the every-
day world wash over There is rarely in this second type any easy kind
of absorption There is only a visible evidence of having been made of a
different substance one that repels Also from them it is almost impos-
sible to give to the world what it will welcome or reward For how does
this second type hold their arms Across their chest Behind their back
And how do they find food to eat and then prepare this food And how
do they receive a check or endorse it And what also of the difficulties of
love or being loved its expansiveness the way it is used for markets and
indentured moods

And what is this second substance And how does it come to have as one
of its qualities the resistance of the world as it is And also what is the
person made of the second substance  Is this a human or more or less
than one Where is the true impermeable community of the second human
whose arms do not easily arrange themselves and for whom the salaries
and weddings and garages do not come

These are perhaps not two sorts of persons but two kinds of fortune The
first is soft and regular The second is a baffled kind and magnetic only to
the second substance and made itself out of a different second substance
and having at its end a second and almost blank-faced reward"

I might have gone as I have gone this year

""O yes I see him One that boat has brought
Which dropped down Channel round Saint Albans Head
So commonplace a youth calls not my thought""

""You see that man"" — ""Why yes I told you yes
Of an idling town-sort thin hair brown in hue
And as the evening light scants less and less
He looks up at a star as many do""

""You see that man"" — ""Nay leave me"" then I plead
""I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea
And it grows dark and I am weary-kneed

And no one notes him now but you and I

And bend with reverence where his ashes lie"""

My face from you my King
Let me rejoice this Sunday noon
And kneel while gray priests sing

It is not wisdom to forget
But since it is my fate
Fill thou my soul with hidden wine
To make this white hour great

My God my God this marvelous hour
I am your son I know
Once in a thousand days your voice
Has laid temptation low"
Hart CraneAt Melville’s Tomb"Often beneath the wave wide from this ledge
The dice of drowned men’s bones he saw bequeath
An embassy Their numbers as he watched
Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured

And wrecks passed without sound of bells
The calyx of death’s bounty giving back
A scattered chapter livid hieroglyph
The portent wound in corridors of shells

Then in the circuit calm of one vast coil
Its lashings charmed and malice reconciled
Frosted eyes there were that lifted altars
And silent answers crept across the stars

Compass quadrant and sextant contrive
No farther tides  High in the azure steeps
Monody shall not wake the mariner
This fabulous shadow only the sea keeps"

chorus riding upstate to Ini Kamoze’s “Here Comes the Hotstepper”

Roy Fisher‘At night on the station platform   ’"At night on the station platform near a pile of baskets a couple em-
braced pressed close together and swaying a little It was hard to
see where the girl’s feet and legs were The suspicion this aroused
soon caused her hands apparently joined behind her lover’s back
to become a small brown paper parcel under the arm of a stout en-
gine-driver who leaned probably drunk against the baskets his
cap so far forward as almost to conceal his face I could not banish
the thought that what I had first seen was in fact his own androgy-
nous fantasy the self-sufficient core of his stupor Such a romantic
thing so tender for him to contain He looked more comic and
complaisant than the couple had done and more likely to fall heav-
ily to the floor

A café with a frosted glass door through which much light is dif-
fused A tall young girl comes out and stands in front of it her face
and figure quite obscured by this milky radiance

She treads out onto a lopsided ochre panel of lit pavement before
the doorway and becomes visible as a coloured shape moving
sharply A wrap of honey and ginger a flared saffron skirt grey-
white shoes She goes off past the Masonic Temple with a young
man he is pale with dark hair and a shrunken earnest face You
could imagine him a size larger Just for a moment as it happens
there is no one else in the street at all Their significance escapes rap-
idly like a scent before the footsteps vanish among the car engines

A man in the police court He looked dapper and poker-faced his
arms straight the long fingers just touching the hem of his checked
jacket Four days after being released from the prison where he had
served two years for theft he had been discovered at midnight cling-
ing like a tree-shrew to the bars of a glass factory-roof He made no
attempt to explain his presence there the luminous nerves that
made him fly up to it were not visible in daylight and the police
seemed hardly able to believe this was the creature they had brought
down in the darkness

In this city the governing authority is limited and mean so limited
that it can do no more than preserve a superficial order It supplies
fuel water and power It removes a fair proportion of the refuse
cleans the streets after a fashion and discourages fighting With
these things and a few more of the same sort it is content This
could never be a capital city for all its size There is no mind in it no
regard The sensitive the tasteful the fashionable the intolerant
and powerful have not moved through it as they have moved
through London evaluating it altering it deliberately setting in
motion wars of feeling about it Most of it has never been seen

In an afternoon of dazzling sunlight in the thronged streets I saw
at first no individuals but a composite monster its unfeeling sur-
faces matted with dust a mass of necks limbs without extremities
trunks without heads unformed stirrings and shovings spilling
across the streets it had managed to get itself provided with

Later as the air cooled flowing loosely about the buildings that
stood starkly among the declining rays the creature began to divide
and multiply At crossings I could see people made of straws rags
cartons the stuffing of burst cushions kitchen refuse Outside the
Grand Hotel a long-boned carrot-haired girl with glasses loping
along and with strips of bright colour rich silky green and blue

   Launch Audio in a New Window""At night the states
I forget them or I wish I was there
in that one under the
Stars It smells like June in this night
so sweet like air
I may have decided that the
States are not that tired
Or I have thought so I have
thought that

At night the states
And the world not that tired
of everyone
Maybe Honey I think that to
say is in
light Or whoever We will
never
replace you We will never re-
place You But
in like a dream the floor is no
longer discursive
To me it doesn’t please me by
being the vistas out my
window do you know what
Of course not I mean
I have no dreams of wake-
fulness In
wakefulness And so to begin
my love

At night the states
talk My initial continuing contr-
diction
my love for you amp that for me
deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest
dust
of it is sweetest but states no longer
how I
would feel Shirt
that shirt has been in your arms
And I have
that shirt is how I feel

At night the states
will you continue in this as-
sociation of
matters my Dearest down
the street from
where the public plaque reminds
that of private
loving the consequential chain
trail is
matters

At night the states
that it doesn’t matter that I don’t
say them remember
them at the end of this claustro-
phobic the
dance I wish I could see I wish
I could
dance her At this night the states
say them
out there That I am am them
indefinitely so and
so wishful passive historic fated
and matter-
simple matter-simple an
eyeful I wish
but I don’t and little melody
Sorry that these
little things don’t happen any
more The states
have drained their magicks
for I have not
seen them Best not to tell But
you
you would always remain I
trust as I will
always be alone

At night the states
whistle Anyone can live I
can I am not doing any-
thing doing this I
discover I love as I figure Wed-
nesday
I wanted to say something in
particular I have been
where I have seen it The God
can The people
do some more

At night the states
I let go of have let don’t
let
Some and some in Florida doing
What takes you so
long I am still with you in that
part of the
park and vice will continue but
I’ll have
a cleaning Maine Who loses
these names
loses I can’t bring it up yet
keeping my
opinions to herself Everybody in
any room is a
smuggler I walked fiery and
talked in the
stars of the automatic weapons
and partly for you
Which you You know
At night the states
have told it already Have
told it I
know it But more that they
don’t know I
know it too

At night the states
whom I do stand before in
judgment I
think that they will find
me fair not
that they care in fact nor do
I right now
though indeed I am they and
we say
that not that I’ve
erred nor
lost my way though perhaps
they did did
they and now he is dead
but you
you are not Yet I am this
one lost
again lost amp found by one-
self
Who are you to dare sing to me

At night the states
accompany me while I sit here
or drums
there are always drums what for
so I
won’t lose my way the name of
a
personality say not California
I am not
sad for you though I could be
I remember
climbing up a hill under tall
trees
getting home I was
going to say that the air was
fair I was
always saying something like
that but
that’s not it now and that
that’s not it
isn’t it either

At night the states
dare sing to me they who seem
tawdry
any more I’ve not thought I
loved them only
you it’s you whom I love
the states are not good to me as
I am to them
though perhaps I am not
when I think of your being
so beautiful

but is that your beauty
or could it be
theirs I’m having such a
hard time remembering
any of their names
your being beautiful belongs
to nothing
I don’t believe they should
praise you
but I seem to believe they
should
somehow let you go

At night the states
and when you go down to
Washington
witness how perfectly anything
in particular
sheets of thoughts what a waste
of sheets at
night I remember something
about an
up-to-date theory of time I
have my
own white rose for I have
done
something well but I’m not
clear
what it is Weathered perhaps
but that’s
never done What’s done is
perfection

At night the states
ride the train to Baltimore
we will try to acknowledge what was
but that’s not the real mirror
is it nor
is it empty or only my eyes
are
Ride the car home from Washington
no
they are not Ride the subway
home from
Pennsylvania Station The states
are blind eyes
stony smooth shut in moon-
light My
French is the shape of this
book
that means I

At night the states
the  pieces I couldn’t just
walk on by Why
aren’t they beautiful enough
in a way that does not
beg to wring
something from a dry wet
something
Call my name

At night the states
making life not explaining anything
but all the popular songs say call
my name
oh call my name and if I call
it out myself to
you call mine out instead as our
poets do
will you still walk on by I
have
loved you for so long You
died
and on the wind they sang
your name to me
but you said nothing Yet you
said once before
and there it is there but it is
so still
Oh being alone I call out my
name
and once you did and do still in
a way
you do call out your name
to these states whose way is to walk
on by that’s why I write too much

At night the states
whoever you love that’s who you
love
the difference between chaos and
star I believe and
in that difference they believed
in some
funny way but that wasn’t
what I
I believed that out of this
fatigue would be
born a light what is fatigue
there is a man whose face
changes continually
but I will never something
I will
never with regard to it or
never regard
I will regard yours tomorrow
I will wear purple will I
and call my name

At night the states
you who are alive you who are dead
when I love you alone all night and
that is what I do
until I could never write from your
being enough
I don’t want that trick of making
it be coaxed from
the words not tonight I want it
coaxed from
myself but being not that But I’d
feel more
comfortable about it being words
if it
were if that’s what it were for these
are the
States where what words are true
are words
Not myself Montana Illinois

   Launch Audio in a New Window""At nights birds hammered my unborn
child’s heart to strength each strike bringing

bones and spine to glow her lungs pestled
loud as the sea I was raised a sea anemone

among women who cursed their hearts
out soured themselves never-brides

into veranda shades talcum and tea moistened
their quivering jaws prophetic without prophecy

Anvil-black gleaming garlic nubs the pageant arrived with sails unfurled
from Colchis and I rejoiced like a broken

asylum to see burning sand grains skittering ice
shekels clapped in my chest I smashed my head against a lightbulb

and light sprinkled my hair I rejoiced a poui
tree hit by the sun in the room a man a man"
Reginald GibbonsAt Noon"The thick-walled room’s cave-darkness
cool in summer soothes
by saying This is the truth not the taut
cicada-strummed daylight
Rest here out of the flame—the thick air’s
stirred by the fan’s four
slow-moving spoons under the house the stone
has its feet in deep water
Outside even the sun god dressed in this life
as a lizard abruptly rises
on stiff legs and descends blasé toward the shadows"
Thorpe MoeckelAt Popham Beach"Haze of wave spume towards Small Point
Seguin Island Light like a whales spout—
maybe life washes itself here cools off
It never comes clean See all the sails up
and full in the windy parade of skin
and sand and brine Soon the rocks will pluck
each waves feathers Soon the beach
like the moon waning will be /th its size
Somewhere else—maybe Ireland—the tide
will bottom out then For now the sun
blesses the bodies at home in theirs
and those less so to ruin and ruins aftermath—
whatever that is—and the waves rolling in
little snowplows nimbus in miniature how
the beach fishhooks east one child—
is that mine or some spirit I was one more
usher of—face up arms and legs
scraping a temporary angel in the sand"
Susan StewartAt Six"for Edward Hirsch
Like a distant singing like a finger sizzling
for just one moment on the iron it almost
hurts Almost But then something pulls
away and the smooth belly of evening
slides over the earth the pines and the spaniels
stop howling and suddenly drop off to sleep
While the air is numb with the drowsiness
of clouds the needle sails free of the scars
on the record and the record player lifts
its artificial arm This hurts
But then a boy lays his cards on his bedspread
the way a sailor spreads his sails
on the sand and even this reminds me
of tables being set of a woman calling
and calling her children through blistered
hands Then something lets go
and in her left palm she sees her own eyes
and in her right the evening’s first star
pulls her toward the distant
singing of the sky Then something else
lets go the long sheet of night
winds slowly through the pines
Here and there the lights
go up like a shy applauding"
Paula CunninghamAt St Malachy’s Church"im Marty Crickard
I came to light a candle for a friend
but Jesus had a really bad mustache
and those were only pinpricks in his palms
so I passed on

I came to light a candle for a friend
but Joseph’s hands were manicured
and soft as Fairy Liquid hands
I could not light one there so I passed on

In the corner was a fellow with a cowled robe
and a tonsure like a saucer — he palmed
a young and curly blonde Adonis — so I
passed on then to Benoît-Joseph Labre

a tattered man whose wide eyes blazed
he looked quite mad had beggar’s hands
I liked him I lit two dozen candles didn’t pay
and nicked this book on him before I left

I did all this in honor of my matchless absent friend
whose honest calloused workman’s hands
maintained the half of Belfast
and nothing’s been the same since he passed on"
Gregory DjanikianAt Stanley Bay"Alexandria 
When my grandfather came back
from his swim battered this time
by the treacherous currents the rocks
jutting out of the water like knives

my sister and I sidled into his room
thinking the house too quiet
and saw him like a hurt beast
standing by his bed naked wet

My grandmother was kneeling toweling his calves
my mother was mixing a poultice
“Look at his bruises” my sister was whispering
“and the veins like swollen rivers”

We kept inching toward him
while my grandmother daubed him with cream
and wound him in a bedsheet
and made him odder than any dream of him
“Children” she said turning toward us
“let him sleep this is your grandfather”

We hurried away having said
not a word to him nor he to us
though our eyes had never left his body
and we ached to touch him brush
our fingertips along the webs of cuts
and discolorations in his pale skin

All day we wished he would somehow rise
like a true ghost the sheet ruffling in the drafts
“Grandfather” we whispered at his closed door
“come to us bring us your stories”

but when the last lights were put out that night
and the dark spread about us like a purple bruise
we wished we had never wished what we had
every waft of wind had a rustle to it
and the sound of water was deep in our ears

and by morning he had become for us
in his shut room the ghostliest of imaginings
and keeping our distance we waited
only for his door to suddenly swing forth
and reveal him standing either healed
and smiling and unstrange or what seemed
likelier to us now about to change our lives"
Jason ShinderAt Sunset"Your death must be loved this much

You have to know the grief—now
Standing by the water’s edge

looking down at the wave

touching you You have to lie
stiff arms folded on a heap of earth

and see how far the darkness

will take you I mean it this now—
before the ghost the cold leaves

in your breath rises

before the toes are put together
inside the shoes There it is—the goddamn

orange-going-into-rose descending

circle of beauty and time
You have nothing to be sad about"
Linda PastanAt the Air and Space Museum"When I was
nearly six my

father
opened his magic

doctor bag
two

tongue depressors fastened by
a rubber

band
one flick

of his hairy wrist
and lo

we invented
flight"
Eleanor Ross TaylorAt the Altar"That bag you packed me
when you sent me
to the universe—
camp after camp I’ve opened it
debating whether to unpack—
Not yet not yet—
Why did I feel so much in it
was dangerous on the playground
too good for everyday
feel those splendid fireworks
hazardous to institutions
unmannerly to etiquette
so that time after time
I found myself saying
Not yet

At each new place I faced it
it suggested
Here spread out your things
put on this coat
open this bottle—
No not yet   
sometimes throwing something out
giving things away
lightening my load   

The more I pull out
the more it seems some days
is left inside
the heavier it is

Sometimes I think this package
is almost a door
the opening of which
careening across heaven
could be fatal

Some days now I wonder if I’ll ever
dare face my given garments—
permanently wrinkled
surely out of date—
your travel-thought
wasting in its tissue flesh-corrupt—
till I’ve absorbed it
like those stitches that dissolve
in an incision
where something’s been removed"
Brenda Cárdenas"At the Base of the Blues Tree Una Ofrenda for Jimmy Davis Chicago Blues Man ﻿""after the painting
Á
rbol de Blues
by Roberto Valadez
The hands of this telling tree pull
him from the cobalt bowl sky
bring Jimmy back to the ruins
of Maxwell Street hunched in dusk
He stood where strings intersected
frets like tracks meeting ties
on the Illinois Central’s passage
from the Mississippi Delta
then followed the bread crumbs
of troubadours to this steel city
Twelve-hour shifts beckoned
mexicanos north on the Union Pacific
from Piedras Negras
to Pilsen Back of the Yards

How many grandparents mothers and fathers
pounded stake into soil
snuck or were shoved into boxcars
leapt onto the train’s iron rungs
as it shuddered along the rails
to foundries where they poured
molten metal faced hot licks
of the blast furnace’s growl and hiss
How many lugged themselves north
to slaughterhouses that drooled
rank puddles at their feet This
so sons and daughters might step off
into another era choose instruments of wood and metal
axes of their own timbre

This so Jimmy might mix his own palette—
tune each turquoise pitch and purple tone
into an electric blues old as corridos
but new to the mexicanos who came each
Sunday to the market at Maxwell

New to the ears of Roberto a boy who would keep
his ranchera rhythms close
as a pair of old jeans but grow
into the blues as he listened
to the heirs of Papa Jackson—
Johnny Young Howlin’ Wolf Nighthawk
and Maxwell Jimmy Now Roberto sits in overalls
at an easel splits
the hairs of his brush over how to compose
this ofrenda this homage How
to take Jimmy back in time to the market
whose merchants once hustled
with tricks for trade ancient as Africa as Toltec Mexico
Maxwell whose live blues bands
and car radios belting norteño mixes made
every Sunday a session

How to take Jimmy back
to Maxwell’s gathering spot where he guzzles
from an aluminum garden blooming atop his amp
swings his ax—
fingers climbing its trunk plucking twigs—
while our feet tap the roots
of this wailing tree Notes skip through alleys
of his voice like gravel
pinging off windshields lift a pitch
high enough to singe the autumn sky—
cousin to the red and green gritos of the barrio
only blocks away Twelve bars spin
like metal rims stack like hubcaps
chords crackling in the tin barrels of his laughter
When the people gather he sputters
What did the one-eyed woman say
and waits for them to peer into the devil’s draw
of his eyes before he roars
Where is my one-eyed man

But we barely get to the punch line to the end
of a set before the mayor swings his ax
a claw that rips this árbol de blues up by its roots
before Chicago swings its wrecking ball
to level homes stores restaurants bars
before troops graffiti-blast scrub and cinch-sack it
all but one empty wall
where someone has scrawled Jimmy’s name
among the others in this hall of fame
Willie Hound Dog Honey Boy Sal
the many legends who’ve shared the marrow
of their music of Santana’s hearty
soup with the bones still in it steaming with sabor
and sometimes weeping"
Elizabeth AlexanderAt the Beach"Looking at the photograph is somehow not
unbearable My friends two dead one low
on T-cells his white T-shirt an X-ray
screen for the virus which I imagine
as a single swimming paisley a sardine
with serrated fins and a neon spine

I’m on a train thinking about my friends
and watching two women talk in sign language
I feel the energy and heft their talk
generates the weight of their words in the air
the same heft as your presence in this picture
boys the volume of late summer air at the beach

Did you tea-dance that day Write poems
in the sunlight Vamp with strangers There is
sun under your skin like the gold Sula
found beneath Ajax’s black I calibrate
the weight of your beautiful bones the weight
of your elbow Melvin

on Darrell’s brown shoulder"
William E StaffordAt the Bomb Testing Site"At noon in the desert a panting lizard
waited for history its elbows tense
watching the curve of a particular road
as if something might happen

It was looking at something farther off
than people could see an important scene
acted in stone for little selves
at the flute end of consequences

There was just a continent without much on it
under a sky that never cared less
Ready for a change the elbows waited
The hands gripped hard on the desert"
Joseph O LegaspiAt the Bridal Shop"The gowns and dresses hang
like fleece in their glaring
whiteness sheepskin-softness
the ruffled matrimonial love in which the brides-
in-waiting dance around expectantly
hummingbirds to tulipsI was dragged here
David’s Bridal off the concrete-gray arterial
highways of a naval townI sink into the flush
bachelors’ couch along with other men sprinkled
throughout the shop as my friend and her female compatriots parade
taffeta dresses in monstrous shades of pastels—persimmons
lilacs periwinkles—the colors of weddings and religious
holidaysTrains drag on the floor sleeves drape
like limp pressed sheets of candied fruits
ribbons fluttering like pale leavesI watch
families gathered together the women like worshippers
circling around the smiling brides-to-be as if they were
the anointed onesThe men in turn submerge
deeper into couches into sleep while the haloed
veiled women cannot contain their joy
they flash their winning smiles and they are beautiful"
Richard BrautiganAt the California Institute of Technology"I don’t care how God-damn smart
these guys are I’m bored

It’s been raining like hell all day long
and there’s nothing to do"
Anne SpencerAt the Carnival"Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank
I desire a name for you
Nice as a right glove fits
For you—who amid the malodorous
Mechanics of this unlovely thing
Are darling of spirit and form
I know you—a glance and what you are
Sits-by-the-fire in my heart
My Limousine-Lady knows you or
Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark
Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile
Guilt pins a fig-leaf Innocence is its own adorning
The bull-necked man knows you—this first time
His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health
And thinks not of his avocation
I came incuriously—
Set on no diversion save that my mind
Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds
In the presence of a blind crowd
The color of life was gray
Everywhere the setting seemed right
For my mood Here the sausage and garlic booth
Sent unholy incense skyward
There a quivering female-thing
Gestured assignations and lied
To call it dancing
There too were games of chance
With chances for none
But oh Girl-of-the-Tank at last
Gleaming Girl how intimately pure and free
The gaze you send the crowd
As though you know the dearth of beauty
In its sordid life
We need you—my Limousine-Lady
The bull-necked man and I
Seeing you here brave and water-clean
Leaven for the heavy ones of earth
I am swift to feel that what makes
The plodder glad is good and
Whatever is good is God
The wonder is that you are here
I have seen the queer in queer places
But never before a heaven-fed
Naiad of the Carnival-Tank
Little Diver Destiny for you
Like as for me is shod in silence
Years may seep into your soul
The bacilli of the usual and the expedient
I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day"
Tim NolanAt the Choral Concert"The high school kids are so beautiful
in their lavender blouses and crisp white shirts

They open their mouths to sing with that
far-off stare they had looking out from the crib

Their voices lift up from the marble bed
of the high altar to the blue endless ceiling

of heaven as depicted in the cloudy dome—
and we—as the parents—crane our necks

to see our children and what is above us—
and ahead of us—until the end when we

are invited up to sing with them—sopranos
and altos—tenors and basses—to sing the great

Hallelujah Chorus—and I’m standing with the other
stunned and gray fathers—holding our sheet music—

searching for our parts—and we realize—
our voices are surprisingly rich—experienced—

For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth—
and how do we all know to come in

at exactly the right moment—Forever and ever—
and how can it not seem that we shall reign

forever and ever—in one voice with our beautiful
children—looking out into all those lights"
Umberto FioriAt the Circus"At the center of the lit circle rising
from cotton-candy calf muscles
the White Clown ushers his
eyebrows skyward He grates his ukulele
opens a heart-shaped mouth inhales—
his serenade begins

Nows the time From the shadows
a blast like a trumpeting elephant
obscene ragged The Auguste capers like a fawn
darts away pads around
with his trombone The gold of the slide
slips into and out of the infinite

Everything smells of panther
and piss and mint His gaze fixed
on the clash between the welled tears
and the awful laughing shoes
the little boy grows
ever more grave ever more severe"
Vincent O’SullivanAt the city pound"I’m in charge of a cage I know those that won’t

The disconsolate the abandoned those with recurrent
symptoms the incorrigible mutt — oh a dozen
choices by way of reasons Even so

some won’t Won’t play along once their number’s

Mandy KahnAt the Dorm"Week upon week at the dorm she watched him
working at a table with a pencil in his teeth
eating with a stack of books and papers
reading while he walked His hair was
groups of angry men his sweaty cuffs were wrinkled
at his forearms he seemed to be loved by no one
But always there were pairs of houseflies
hovering above him landing on his nest of notes
trailing him as if with streamers and sound
A farm girl she knew to follow the flies
theyll take you to the milk just pulled to the pail
to the cows haunch where the meat will one day be sweetest
the swelled pond the unlatched gate Everything
she knew was in those notebooks
he would carry her future the distances of islands poles
and stars the reason for the network of mens follies
how to spend the night"
Gail Mazur"At the Ear Nose and Throat Clinic""One of those appointments you postpone
until anxiety propels you to the phone
then have to wait too long for to take
an inconvenient time    Late in the day
an old man and I watch the minute hand

on the waiting room wall I’ve papers
to grade but he wants someone to talk to
and his attendant’s rude so he turns
his whiskery face to me “Y’ know I lived
my whole life in Waltham worked  years

at the watch factory—oh that city used to be
so beautiful now it’s a mess those Cubans
and Puerto Ricans they ruined it”
Coiled in his wheelchair he’s mad
for company probably scared he’s dying



and so am I I don’t remember Watch City
as beautiful the year I was eleven
when Merle and I rode the Grove Street bus
to Moody Street to shoplift haircurlers
and Pond’s Vanishing Cream nickel items

at the Waltham Woolworth’s It was
an old factory town wooden triple-deckers
water rats swimming in the oily river
Merle and I didn’t risk a furtive life
of crime in our well-kempt Auburndale

where we thought we were well-known
and canoers paddled the same Charles River
past our homes And I still wonder
what could have vanished when we rubbed
the mystery elixir on our silky cheeks



His cheeks sucked in this geezer could be
my grandfather forty years ago so
I ignore his racist overture and agree
Waltham was beautiful as the attendant
takes his Social Security card

and whistles “Boy are you old”
then mutters something else in Spanish
The number must be low    “—
that was the first year of Social Security”
the old guy brags The kid forsakes

our ancient history flexes his muscles
He’s probably been listening
to insults for an hour in the Elder Van
he’s bored and angry—why should he be
nice Yet hungry for a distracting

fact or story I encourage the grandfather
I want to be treated well myself some day
when I’ll need it even more than I do now   
My little bids for attention my birds fragile
fluttering words desire to be visible and seen   

“FDR was okay wasn’t he” I’m playing
 it’s what I do to make us both
less lonely reminisce as if we’d shared
the ’s as if I’d been there come
from Sicily or Limerick a seamstress

earning her hard living one town over
I always sat this way with Doc years
after he’d retired his best treasure
besides my golden mother a gold
pocket watch a Handsome Waltham watch—



a different time when the things
a person held or owned weren’t many
but were permanent a part of who you were
So his elegant watch confused me toward
the idea my little dentist grandfather

had some connection to the company
as if he’d labored there a master craftsman
had been rewarded by a grateful boss
His bit of luxury the swirling monogram
on the back which opened with a click

IR for Isaac Rosenberg timepiece
connected by a chain to a safety pin
at his frayed striped trouser pocket
another pin secured his Shawmut bankbook
deposits he’d made decades before



that I’d inherit $ Shawmut branch
nearby the long-gone Waldorf Cafeteria
where he idled weekday mornings
with his cronies also reminiscing
I suppose although then I didn’t think

of it the Good Old Days before
the motorcar before their children
moved away Dexterity and skill gone too
from his arthritic hands He relished
those mornings The black-and-white

tiled floor the nearly empty tables
the Perfection Salad Welsh rarebit
the “bloomberry pie” The counterman
They serve an elegant porridge there
he told me gourmet of the ordinary

State-of-Maine-ah grandfather my Mainiac
The soon-to-be-widowed wives elsewhere
polishing mahogany veneer or playing
bridge or shopping Coolidge Corner
from butcher to baker in prescient

black dresses Old men and women
so relieved to be rid of the burden
of one another for a whole morning
of the tired bickering sentences
of long American marriages of pain

and disappointment What memories
they’d had of courtships long since passed on
to grandchildren and half-false anyway
like studio photographs mythic stories
they could live with now forgotten

the mistakes they’d been too fearful
or devout to rectify I miss that
cafeteria the whole idea of cafeterias
although Doc never took me just pointed
to it on our Sunday drive repeating

paeans to gray porridge something no
description’s glow could make me want
Waltham had them too free-fire zones
a kid alone could enter with five cents
for huge iced cookies black-and-whites



half chocolate half vanilla all Crisco
and white sugar chewed in gluttonous
companionable half-light wonderful—
But who’d know that now Who cares
Merle and I did everything subversive

we could imagine—which wasn’t much
I’m sure I cruised Sin City in my mind
decayed old town—nowhere—but to me
forbidden fruit the  amp  eyelash
curlers odd metal torture instruments

I smuggled home that pinched my lids
and made my lashes angle wildly up
delinquent startled in the bathroom
mirror Tangee lipsticks the size
of my little finger unflattering coral

pink girdles I’d eye furtively wondering
that I’d have to wriggle into one someday
or wear the bony corset my grandmother
assured me was my fate Oh esoteric glamorous
puzzle of the vanished vanishing cream   



Later not so much later the first day
of my driver’s license I drove the family
station wagon down Moody Street and banged
the traffic policeman’s rubber perch
He jumped down before it bounced the street

and yelled me over in a rage Or maybe
he was kindly it’s only my criminal terror
I remember of punishment fine-tuned
my ruined life my new rights vanishing
Hardly a threat I know now the feckless cop

I gripped the steering wheel so hard
to stop the huge recalcitrant Ford doomed
to lose my brand-new temporary license—
How could I think my budding power stripped
I’d ever get the chance to live or drive"
Pierre ReverdyAt the Edge of Time"The stems of  the sun bent over the eye
The sleeping man
The whole of  the earth
And this head heavy with fear
In the night
This complete hole
Vast
And even so streaming with water
The noise
The peals of  little bells mingled with the
Clinking of glasses
And bursts of laughter
The head moves
On the carpet the body shifts
And turns over the warm spot
At the slipping feet of  the animal
It’s that they’re waiting
For the summons of the shock
And the signal of  the eyelid
The ray relaxes
Sleep
Light
And what is left shines at the edge of  the white rock"
Don WelchAt the Edge of Town"Hard to know which is more gnarled
the posts he hammers staples into
or the blue hummocks which run
across his hands like molehills

Work has reduced his wrists
to bones cut out of him
the easy flesh and brought him
down to this the crowbar’s teeth

caught just behind a barb
Again this morning
the crowbar’s neck will make
its blue slip into wood

there will be that moment
when too much strength
will cause the wire to break
But even at  he says

he has to have it right
and more than right
This morning in the pewter light
he has the scars to prove it"
Reginald Dwayne Betts"At the End of Life a Secret""Everything measured A man twists
a tuft of your hair out for no reason
other than you are naked before him
and he is bored with nakedness Moments
before he was weighing your gallbladder
and then he was staring at the empty space
where your lungs were Even dead we still
say you are an organ donor as if something
other than taxes outlasts death Your feet
are regular feet Two of them and there is no
mark to suggest you were an expert mathematician
nothing that suggests that a woman loved
you until you died From the time your body
was carted before him to the time your
dead body is being sent to the coffin
every pound is accounted for except  grams
The man is a praying man and has figured
what it means He says this is the soul finally
after the breath has gone The soul less than
$ worth of crack— grams—

James WrightAt the Executed Murderers Grave"for J L D

Why should we do this What good is it to us Above all how can we do such a thing How can it possibly be done
—Freud

My name is James A Wright and I was born
Twenty-five miles from this infected grave
In Martins Ferry Ohio where one slave
To Hazel-Atlas Glass became my father
He tried to teach me kindness I return
Only in memory now aloof unhurried
To dead Ohio where I might lie buried
Had I not run away before my time
Ohio caught George Doty Clean as lime
His skull rots empty here Dying’s the best
Of all the arts men learn in a dead place
I walked here once I made my loud display
Leaning for language on a dead man’s voice
Now sick of lies I turn to face the past
I add my easy grievance to the rest


Doty if I confess I do not love you
Will you let me alone I burn for my own lies
The nights electrocute my fugitive
My mind I run like the bewildered mad
At St Clair Sanitarium who lurk
Arch and cunning under the maple trees
Pleased to be playing guilty after dark
Staring to bed they croon self-lullabies
Doty you make me sick I am not dead
I croon my tears at fifty cents per line


Idiot he demanded love from girls
And murdered one Also he was a thief
He left two women and a ghost with child
The hair foul as a dog’s upon his head
Made such revolting Ohio animals
Fitter for vomit than a kind man’s grief
I waste no pity on the dead that stink
And no love’s lost between me and the crying
Drunks of Belaire Ohio where police
Kick at their kidneys till they die of drink
Christ may restore them whole for all of me
Alive and dead those giggling muckers who
Saddled my nightmares thirty years ago
Can do without my widely printed sighing
Over their pains with paid sincerity
I do not pity the dead I pity the dying


I pity myself because a man is dead
If Belmont County killed him what of me
His victims never loved him Why should we
And yet nobody had to kill him either
It does no good to woo the grass to veil
The quicklime hole of a man’s defeat and shame
Nature-lovers are gone To hell with them
I kick the clods away and speak my name


This grave’s gash festers Maybe it will heal
When all are caught with what they had to do
In fear of love when every man stands still
By the last sea
And the princes of the sea come down
To lay away their robes to judge the earth
And its dead and we dead stand undefended everywhere
And my bodies—father and child and unskilled criminal—
Ridiculously kneel to bare my scars
My sneaking crimes to God’s unpitying stars


Staring politely they will not mark my face
From any murderer’s buried in this place
Why should they We are nothing but a man


Doty the rapist and the murderer
Sleeps in a ditch of fire and cannot hear
And where in earth or hell’s unholy peace
Men’s suicides will stop God knows not I
Angels and pebbles mock me under trees
Earth is a door I cannot even face
Order be damned I do not want to die
Even to keep Belaire Ohio safe
The hackles on my neck are fear not grief
Open dungeon Open roof of the ground
I hear the last sea in the Ohio grass
Heaving a tide of gray disastrousness
Wrinkles of winter ditch the rotted face
Of Doty killer imbecile and thief
Dirt of my flesh defeated underground"
Edith SitwellAt the Fair"I Springing Jack

Green wooden leaves clap light away
Severely practical as they

Shelter the children candy-pale
The chestnut-candles flicker fail   

The showman’s face is cubed clear as
The shapes reflected in a glass

Of water—glog glut a ghost’s speech
Fumbling for space from each to each

The fusty showman fumbles must
Fit in a particle of dust

The universe for fear it gain
Its freedom from my cube of brain

Yet dust bears seeds that grow to grace
Behind my crude-striped wooden face

As I a puppet tinsel-pink
Leap on my springs learn how to think—

Till like the trembling golden stalk
Of some long-petalled star I walk

Through the dark heavens and the dew
Falls on my eyes and sense thrills through


II The Ape Watches “Aunt Sally”

The apples are an angel’s meat
The shining dark leaves make clear sweet

The juice green wooden fruits alway
Fall on these flowers as white as day—

Clear angel-face on hairy stalk
Soul grown from flesh an ape’s young talk

And in this green and lovely ground
The Fair world-like turns round and round

And bumpkins throw their pence to shed
Aunt Sally’s wooden clear-striped head—

I do not care if men should throw
Round sun and moon to make me go—

As bright as gold and silver pence   
They cannot drive their black shade hence"
Paisley RekdalAt the Fishhouses"And the black water under the boats with their pools
of bilge rainbowed out like rinds
of steak fat the salt thick
in my nostrils but pleasant too details
I still remember from Bishop’s poem everything
else about it lost At the docks
I watched my friend slip
in her rubber boots the wide wet planks
glossy with mosses You must walk
duckfooted to get to the boats the black and orange
fishing barrels the air with its tang
of rusted metals There are always hooks
and anchors to be found nets and scrapings
of wood planed by chisel the way
my great-grandmother was said
to have worked employed as a shipwright
on the city’s waterways in the ’s according
to the newspaper clipping my grandmother
photocopies for me each Christmas
The description of her gunmetal hair
and slim torso clad in overalls the hands
she held out for the Times reporter
“Callused” he noted “strong as a man’s”
does not recall the woman
I remember for her farm in Bothell
before it became a Seattle suburb helping me gather
raspberries from the long canes
she planted by her porch We spent an afternoon
together sweating in the same long-sleeved
checkered shirts she’d sewn us according
to the photo I no longer have and cannot remember
whether is the source or confirmation
of this memory only the papery gray-green
streaks of road dust on the canes a bowl
of chipped porcelain inside of which
were raspberries Very red very sweet furred
like my friend’s upper lip I remember
between my teeth as we stood
on the docks The smell
of iron and winter mist her mouth
like nothing I have tasted since"
Elizabeth Bishop"At the Fishhouses
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window""Although it is a cold evening
down by one of the fishhouses
an old man sits netting
his net in the gloaming almost invisible
a dark purple-brown
and his shuttle worn and polished
The air smells so strong of codfish
it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water
The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs
and narrow cleated gangplanks slant up
to storerooms in the gables
for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on
All is silver the heavy surface of the sea
swelling slowly as if considering spilling over
is opaque but the silver of the benches
the lobster pots and masts scattered
among the wild jagged rocks
is of an apparent translucence
like the small old buildings with an emerald moss
growing on their shoreward walls
The big fish tubs are completely lined
with layers of beautiful herring scales
and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered
with creamy iridescent coats of mail
with small iridescent flies crawling on them
Up on the little slope behind the houses
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass
is an ancient wooden capstan
cracked with two long bleached handles
and some melancholy stains like dried blood
where the ironwork has rusted
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike
He was a friend of my grandfather
We talk of the decline in the population
and of codfish and herring
while he waits for a herring boat to come in
There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb
He has scraped the scales the principal beauty
from unnumbered fish with that black old knife
the blade of which is almost worn away

Down at the water’s edge at the place
where they haul up the boats up the long ramp
descending into the water thin silver
tree trunks are laid horizontally
across the gray stones down and down
at intervals of four or five feet

Cold dark deep and absolutely clear
element bearable to no mortal
to fish and to seals    One seal particularly
I have seen here evening after evening
He was curious about me He was interested in music
like me a believer in total immersion
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns
I also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God”
He stood up in the water and regarded me
steadily moving his head a little
Then he would disappear then suddenly emerge
almost in the same spot with a sort of shrug
as if it were against his better judgment
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear
the clear gray icy water    Back behind us
the dignified tall firs begin
Bluish associating with their shadows
a million Christmas trees stand
waiting for Christmas The water seems suspended
above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones
I have seen it over and over the same sea the same
slightly indifferently swinging above the stones
icily free above the stones
above the stones and then the world
If you should dip your hand in
your wrist would ache immediately
your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn
as if the water were a transmutation of fire
that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame
If you tasted it it would first taste bitter
then briny then surely burn your tongue
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be
dark salt clear moving utterly free
drawn from the cold hard mouth
of the world derived from the rocky breasts
forever flowing and drawn and since
our knowledge is historical flowing and flown"

Larry Levis"At the Grave of My Guardian Angel St Louis Cemetery New Orleans""for Gerald Stern
At sixteen I was so vulnerable to every influence
That the overcast light making the trash of addicts amp sunbathers suddenly clearer
On the paths of the city park seemed death itself spreading its shade
Over the leaves the swan boats the gum wrappers and the quarreling ducks
It took nothing more than a few clouds straying over the sun
And I would begin falling through myself like an anvil or a girls comb or a feather
Dropped tossed or spiraling by pure chance down the silent air shaft of a warehouse
The spiderweb in one fourth-floor window catching in that moment the sunset
For in such a moment to fall was to be simplified amp pure
With a neck snapped like a stem instead
Of whoever I turned out to be
Wiping the window glass clear with one cuff
To gaze out at a two-hundred-year-old live oak tethering
The courtyard to its quiet
The tree so old it has outlived even its life as a cliché
And has survived with no apparent effort every boy who marched like a wilderness
Himself past it on his way to enlist in Lee’s army
And now it swells gently in the mist amp the early sunlight
So who saved me And for what purpose
Beneath the small angel cut from cheap stone there was nothing
But my name amp the years -
And the tense muggy little quiet of a place where singing ends
And where there is only the leftover colored chalk amp the delusions of voodoo
The small bones amp X’s on stones signifying the practitioner’s absence
Entirely voluntary from the gnat swirl amp humming of time
To which the chalked X on stone is the final theory it is even illiterate
It is not even a lock of hair on a grave It is not even
The small crowd of roughnecks at Poe’s funeral nor the blind drunkard
Laughing there the white of his eyes the unfurling of a cold surf below a cliff—
Which is the blank wave sprawl of fact receding under the cries of gulls—
Which is not enough




I should rush out to my office amp eat a small freckled apple leftover
From  amp entirely wizened amp rotted by sunlight now
Then lay my head on my desk amp dream again of horses grazing riderless amp still saddled
Under the smog of the freeway cloverleaf amp within earshot of the music waltzing with itself out
Of the topless bars amp laundromats of East LA

I should go back again amp try to talk my friend out of his diet
Of methamphetamine amp vodka yogurts amp the look of resignation spreading over his face
Like the gray shade of a tree spreading over a sleeper in the park—

For it is all or nothing in this life for there is no other
And without beauty Bakunin will go on making his forlorn amp unreliable little bombs in the cold amp Oswald will adjust
The lenses on the scope of his rifle the one
Friend he has carried with him all the way out of his childhood
The silent wood of its stock as musical to him in its grain as any violin
This must have been what they meant
Lincoln amp Whitman joining hands one overcast spring afternoon
To stroll together through the mud of Washington at the end
Of the war the tears welling up in both their eyes
Neither one of them saying a word their hands clasped tightly together
As they walk for block after block past
The bay sorrel chestnut and dapple-gray tail swish of horses
And waiting carriages amp neither one of them noticing as they stroll amp weave
The harness gall on the winters of a mare
Nor the gnats swarming over it alighting now on the first trickle of blood uncaking from the sore
And the underfed rib cage showing through its coat each time it inhales
Like the tines of a rake combing the battleground to overturn
Something that might identify the dead at Antietam
The rake keeps flashing in the late autumn light
And Bakunin with a face impassive as a barn owl’s amp never straying from the one true text of flames
And Lincoln absentmindedly trying to brush away the wart on his cheek
As he dresses for the last time
As he fumbles for a pair of cuff links in a silk-lined box
As he anticipates some pure amp frivolous pleasure
As he dreams for a moment amp is a woman for a moment
And in his floating joy has no idea what is going to happen to him in the next hour
And Oswald dozing over a pamphlet by Trotsky in the student union
Oh live oak thoughtless beauty in a century of pulpy memoirs
Spreading into the early morning sunlight
As if it could never be otherwise as if it were all a pure proclamation of leaves amp a final quiet—




But it’s all or nothing in this life it’s smallpox quicklime amp fire
It’s the extinct whistling of an infantry it is all the faded rosettes of blood
Turning into this amnesia of billboards amp the ceaseless hunh of traffic
It goes on amp I go with it it spreads into the sun amp air amp throws out a fast shade
That will never sleep and I go with it it breaks Lincoln amp Poe into small drops of oil spreading
Into endless swirls on the water amp I recognize the pattern




There there now Nothing
Stop your sniveling Stop sifting dirt through your fingers into your glass of milk
A milk still white as stone whiter even Why don’t you finish it
We’d better be getting on our way soon sweet Nothing
I’ll buy you something pretty from the store
I’ll let you wear the flower in your hair even though you can only vanish entirely underneath its brown implacable petals
Stop your sniveling I can almost see the all night diner looming
Up ahead with its lights amp its flashing sign a testimony to failure
I can almost see our little apartment under the freeway overpass the cups on the mantle rattling continually—
The Mojave one way the Pacific the other
At least we’ll have each other’s company
And it’s not as if you held your one wing tattered as it was in contempt
For being only one It’s not as if you were frivolous
It’s not like that It’s not like that at all
Riding beside me your seat belt around your invisible waist Sweet Nothing
Sweet sweet Nothing"
John Lee ClarkAt the Holiday Gas Station"Near the Naked Juices I passed
A man my fingers walking
Across his back he turned and held up
A box said what
Might this be I said oh
You’re tactile too what’s your name
He said William Amos Miller I said
I thought you were born in  he said so
You know who I am yes you’re the man
Who journeyed to the center of Earth
In your mind he smiled on my arm said do
You know that the Earth also journeyed
To the center of my mind I said
I never thought of that he asked
Again about the box I shook it sniffed
Said Mike and Ike is it fruit
He inquired not exactly well
I think I shall have an apple wait
You haven’t paid oh
My money nowadays is no money he pushed
Outside we walked across the ice
To the intersection he made to go across
Wait you can’t go across we have to wait
For help oh help he said crouching
Until our hands touched the cold ground
He said I said we said we see
With our hands I jumped up and said you’re the man"
Moses ibn EzraAt the Hour of Closing"Lord of wondrous workings
grant us understanding—
now at the hour of closing

A chosen few are called
their eyes toward you lifting—
they stand exalted in their trembling
now at the hour of closing

They pour forth their souls
erase then their straying—
and grant them Lord your absolution
now at the hour of closing

Be a shelter for them
through all their suffering
consign them only to rejoicing
now at the hour of closing

Show them your compassion
in your justice turning
on all who brought oppression to them—
now at the hour of closing

Recall their fathers’ merit
and count it as merit for them
renew their days as once they were
now at the hour of closing

Call for the year of grace—
the remnant flock’s returning
to Oholìbah and Oholàh—
now at the hour of closing"
William FullerAt the House of the Rhyming Weir"An idea is sometimes sweetened by refusing to be expressed
if it attends solicitously to this failure and urges us on to
discover the true impediment to its adaptation In that
spirit and bearing that intention within us we note here as
elsewhere there are generally three alternative courses The
ﬁrst is simply to accept without question an explanation
someone in our proximity and whom we know proffers and
then elects to modify out of concern that small details are
escaping to set up camp opposite what is being said The
second is to surrender one’s reluctance to withdraw from the
presence of an unsolved problem by grabbing crudely at
vacant affirmations that nothing further need be done that
everything to be accomplished was accomplished well before
current advocates approached the threshold coaxed forward
by the desire to indulge their own vanity The third is to
remain absolutely uncommitted to any speciﬁc course and
to insist that the process begin anew each time contending
that no information will ever be adequate to the task of
judgment that the requirements as they evolve will make
each element moot or at a minimum place the likelihood
of resolution in ever greater doubt over time with the
paradoxical effect that the impulse to continue is not
thereby diminished only channeled into a narrower more
determined form Although no beneﬁts are likely to accrue
from this last course it’s unquestionably the one most often
followed owing perhaps to people’s need to test the strength
of a membrane designed to repel assault or their perennial
enchantment with kaleidoscopic complications spreading
over the earth as time walks through the sky"

Jon LoomisAt the Lake House"Wind and the sound of wind—
across the bay a chainsaw revs

about my father who in his last year
after his surgery told my mother

he wasnt sorry—that hed cried
when the other woman left him
that his time with her

had made him happier than anything
hed ever done And my mother
whod cooked and cleaned for him

all those years cared for him
after his heart attack could not
understand why he liked the other

woman more than her
but he did And she told me
that after he died she never went

to visit his grave—not once

after thinking that nothing else mattered

And what was I thinking of when I stopped
thinking about Love Death of course—what else
could take Love’s place What else could hold such force

I thought about how far away Death once
had seemed how unexpected that it could
happen to someone I knew quite well

how impossible that this should be the
normal thing as natural as frost and
winter I thought about the way we’d aged

how skin fell into wrinkles how eyes grew

Ellen Bryant Voigt"At the Movie Virginia ""This is how it was
they had their own churches their own schools
schoolbuses football teams bands and majorettes
separate restaurants in all the public places
their own bathrooms at the doctor’s
their own waiting room in the Tribune
a column for their news in the village
a neighborhood called Sugar Hill
uneven rows of unresponsive houses
that took the maids back in each afternoon—
in our homes used the designated door
on Trailways sat in the back and at the movie
paid at a separate entrance stayed upstairs
Saturdays a double feature drew the local kids
as the town bulged families surfacing
for groceries medicine and wine
the black barber white clerks in the stores—crowds
lined the sidewalks swirled through the courthouse yard
around the stone soldier and the flag

and still I never saw them on the street
It seemed a chivalric code
laced the milk you’d try not to look
and they would try to be invisible
Once on my way to the creek
I went without permission to the tenants’
log cabin near the barns and when Aunt Susie
opened the door a cave yawned and beyond her square
leonine freckled face in the hushed interior
Joe White lumbered up from the table six unfolding
feet of him dark as a gun-barrel his head bent
to clear the chinked rafters and I caught
the terrifying smell of sweat and grease
smell of the woodstove nightjar straw mattress—
This was rural Piedmont upper south
we lived on a farm but not in poverty
When finally we got our own TV the evening news
with its hooded figures of the Ku Klux Klan
seemed like another movie—King Solomon’s Mines
the serial of Atlantis in the sea
By then I was thirteen
and no longer went to movies to see movies
The downstairs forged its attentions forward
toward the lit horizon but leaning a little
to one side or the other arranging the pairs
that would own the county stores and farms everything
but easy passage out of there—
and through my wing-tipped glasses the balcony
took on a sullen glamor whenever the film
sputtered on the reel when the music died
and the lights came on I swiveled my face
up to where they whooped and swore
to the smoky blue haze and that tribe
of black and brown licorice coffee
taffy red oak sweet tea—

wanting to look not knowing how to see
I thought it was a special privilege
to enter the side door climb the stairs
and scan the even rows below—trained bears
in a pit herded by the stringent rule
while they were free lounging above us
their laughter pelting down on us like trash"
Florence Ripley MastinAt the Movies"They swing across the screen in brave array
Long British columns grinding the dark grass
Twelve months ago they marched into the grey
Of battle yet again behold them pass

One lifts his dusty cap his hair is bright
I meet his eyes eager and young and bold
The picture quivers into ghostly white
Then I remember and my heart grows cold"
Kenneth PatchenAt the New Year"In the shape of this night in the still fall
of snow Father
In all that is cold and tiny these little birds
and children
In everything that moves tonight the trolleys
and the lovers Father
In the great hush of country in the ugly noise
of our cities
In this deep throw of stars in those trenches
where the dead are Father
In all the wide land waiting and in the liners
out on the black water
In all that has been said bravely in all that is
mean anywhere in the world Father
In all that is good and lovely in every house
where sham and hatred are
In the name of those who wait in the sound
of angry voices Father
Before the bells ring before this little point in time
has rushed us on
Before this clean moment has gone before this night
turns to face tomorrow Father
There is this high singing in the air
Forever this sorrowful human face in eternity’s window
And there are other bells that we would ring Father
Other bells that we would ring"
Cristin O’Keefe AptowiczAt the Office Holiday Party"I can now confirm that I am not just fatter
than everyone I work with but I’m also fatter
than all their spouses Even the heavily bearded
bear in accounting has a little otter-like boyfriend

When my co-workers brightly introduce me
as “the funny one in the office” their spouses
give them a look which translates to Well duh
then they both wait for me to say something funny

A gaggle of models comes shrieking into the bar
to further punctuate why I sometimes hate living
in this city They glitter a shiny gang of scissors
I don’t know how to look like I’m not struggling

Sometimes on the subway back to Queens
I can tell who’s staying on past the Lexington stop
because I have bought their shoes before at Payless
They are shoes that fool absolutely no one

Everyone wore their special holiday party outfits
It wasn’t until I arrived at the bar that I realized
my special holiday party outfit was exactly the same
as the outfits worn by the restaurant’s busboys

While I’m standing in line for the bathroom
another patron asks if I’m there to clean it"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""What images could yet suggest their range
of tender colours thick as old brocade
or shot silk or flowers on a dress
where black and rose and lime seem to caress
the red that starts to shimmer as they fade

Like something half-remembered from a dream
they come from places we have never seen

They chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream

Here the macaw clings at the rings to show
the young galahs talking as they feed
with feathers soft and pink as dawn on snow
that it too has a dry and dusky tongue
Their murmuring embraces every need
from languid vanity to wildest greed

In the far corner sit two smoky crones
their heads together in a kind of love
One cleans the other’s feathers while it moans
The others seem to whisper behind fans
while noble dandies gamble in a room
asserting values everyone rejects

A lidded eye observes and it reflects

The peacocks still pretend they own the yard

For all the softness how the beaks are hard"

Now he’s on to science a poem
about hydrogen I think he’s trying
to imagine himself turning into hydrogen
Maybe he’ll succeed I’m imagining
myself sliding up his wife’s fluid
rhythmic lusciously curved black-
stockinged legs imagining them arched
around my shoulders wrapped around my back
My God why doesn’t he write poems about her
He will no doubt once she leaves him
leaves him for another poet perhaps
the observant uninnocent one who knows
a poem when it sits down in a room with him"
David HernandezAt the Post Office"The line is long processional glacial
and the attendant a giant stone cobalt blue
with flecks of white I’m not so much
looking at a rock but a slab of night
The stone asks if anything inside the package
is perishable When I say no the stone
laughs muted thunderclap meaning
everything decays not just fruit
or cut flowers but paper ink the CD
I burned with music and my friend
waiting to hear the songs some little joy
after chemo eroded the tumor I know flesh
is temporary and memory a tilting barn
the elements dismantle nail by nail
I know the stone knows a millennia of rain
and wind will even grind away
his ragged face and all of this slow erasing
is just a prelude to when the swelling
universe burns out goes dark holds
nothing but black holes the bones of stars
and planets a vast silence The stone
is stone-faced The stone asks how soon
I want the package delivered As fast
as possible I say then start counting the days"
Robert VanderMolenAt the Pub with the Museum Staff"As if  anyone has the desire      
Vickey trailed off pouring another lager

Therell be nothing left
But fur and bone as my lawyer once explained

To my ex she resumed tapping a long cigarette
On the bar My youre a bit snarky tonight

Said Luther Maybe you need a change of  venue
A beach with your breath on it

Oh she replied nodding towards the far corner booth
These writers are so obnoxious

I wish theyd find a new place to complain
Ha said Hillary they wouldnt know a good story

If  it bit em in the butt Plus added Vickey
Theres always the lurking danger

One may launch into a speech on human nature
Ill back that said Rick who when animated

Would lick his index finger and sweep it back and forth
As if quickly turning pages of a catalog

Theyre just a bunch of spare parts clogging a garage
Hear hear exclaimed Hillary lets give it to the boors

And literary whores

How a bonfire magnifies everything Or that early
Skift of snow across brown meadows

When you still havent canned the peaches
Settle down Rick said Luther this isnt Chicago

Indeed Vickey countered this town used to be known
As Little  Jerusalem by certain parties in the old days

All the churches And hypocrite politicians
Added Luther Well its all downhill from the north

Where wanness began its mission continued Rick
Waving his empty pint Jesus you can be a bore said Vickey

All heroes become bores eventually instructed Hillary

But did you know when Rick was born
He looked like a little worm His aunt told me —

Luther studying her profile said
I was a little worm too"
Chard DeNiord"At the Putney Co-Op an Opera""Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love
past blue automobiles in driveways home to our silent cottage
—Allen Ginsberg
""Go ahead"" I say to my neighbor at the Putney Co-op who tells
me he cant complain ""Let it out Its mid-March and theres still
two feet of snow on the ground Fukushima has just melted down and
the Washington Monument cracked at its pyramidion Put down your
bags and sing How many times dear father graybeard lonely old
courage teacher must you walk down the aisles as a randy eidolon
humming your tunes for us to start Our song begins in silence and grows
to a buzz We make it up as we go along then watch our numbers swell—
ten thousand members who have eyes to see and ears to hear Who fly
like a swarm to join us in our chambers which are these aisles""

Im singing without knowing it carrying the tune of main things
lamenting the prices with Bernie Sanders My neighbor joins me
for no other reason than singing along as a member of the cast we call
the multitudes of lonely shoppers I roam the aisles with the sadness
of America juggling onions blessing the beets Its a local stage on
which the country opens like a flower that no one sees beside the road

In my hungry fatigue Im shopping for images which are free on the highest
shelf but costly in their absence—the only ingredient here that heals my sight
of blindness I see you Walt Whitman pointing your beard toward axis
mundi by the avocados reading the labels as if they were lines weighing
the tomatoes on the scale of your palms pressing the pears with your thumbs
the way you did in Huntington Camden and Brooklyn And you also Ruth
and Hayden at the checkout counter with empty bags you claim are full
of apples almonds and bananas What can you say to those outside who
havent read your poems Who find it hard to get the news from poetry
but die miserably every day for lack of what is found there

Its night The Connecticut slips by across Rt  The moon is my egg
and stars my salt I score the music of the carrots scallions and corn in
the frost of the freezer windows The sough of traffic on  washes my ears
with the sound of tires on blue macadamThe doors close in an hour"
TJ JarrettAt the Repast"When we gathered at the house while the men all looked at their shoes and the women whisperedbaby baby baby she sat down with a fist full of paper napkins and folded them into birds When she filled her hands she crossed the room to the hearth and threw a bird into the flames then another then another until she had destroyed all she created Years later when I asked her what she meant she couldn’t rememberThe worst has already happened she saidWhat good is metaphor to us now"
Yvor WintersAt the San Francisco Airport"To my daughter 
This is the terminal the light
Gives perfect vision false and hard
The metal glitters deep and bright
Great planes are waiting in the yard—
They are already in the night

And you are here beside me small
Contained and fragile and intent
On things that I but half recall—
Yet going whither you are bent
I am the past and that is all

But you and I in part are one
The frightened brain the nervous will
The knowledge of what must be done
The passion to acquire the skill
To face that which you dare not shun

The rain of matter upon sense
Destroys me momently The score
There comes what will come The expense
Is what one thought and something more—
One’s being and intelligence

This is the terminal the break
Beyond this point on lines of air
You take the way that you must take
And I remain in light and stare—
In light and nothing else awake"
Carol Muske-DukesAt the School for the Gifted"Yes I wanted them to levitate
Unfortunately I hadnt a leg to stand on
Cut-out camels plodded across the blackboards high
sill Yet the desert below refused to unfurl its
mica wings When I asked them to try to remember
to release a soap bubble from their marvelous arsenal

of wands they resisted They lined up suspicious
in individual spotlights The fountain inside
the scissored palm could only rise so high
maybe just a trumpeted C Which is high but
not like those huge blue dreams that used to float by
shot from cloud-atomizers the original public breeze

on its back in the grass Lets try to guess who
or what is being borne up by this caravan of thin-
skinned humps a-bulge inoculated I tell you
every one has a rider a crop Its been done
this way for some time If we pause here by the pillars
of sand up to our poet-knees in anarchy wont each

gulp of hoarded water from the toppled monument be
sweeter passed hand to hand in the sun-colored dipper
Up to our thighs in it now and spared what drills it-
self into the rock daily so it can claim to know zero
after zero and make that nothing into a sound like
silent bells split parched hooves plodding"
Robert Louis StevensonAt the Sea-Side"When I was down beside the sea
A wooden spade they gave to me
To dig the sandy shore
My holes were empty like a cup
In every hole the sea came up
Till it could come no more"

  At the Somme The Song of the Mud""This is the song of the mud
The pale yellow glistening mud that covers the hills like satin
The grey gleaming silvery mud that is spread like enamel over the valleys
The frothing squirting spurting liquid mud that gurgles along the road beds
The thick elastic mud that is kneaded and pounded and squeezed under the hoofs of the horses
The invincible inexhaustible mud of the war zone


This is the song of the mud the uniform of the poilu
His coat is of mud his great dragging flapping coat that is too big for him and too heavy
His coat that once was blue and now is grey and stiff with the mud that cakes to it
This is the mud that clothes him His trousers and boots are of mud
And his skin is of mud
And there is mud in his beard
His head is crowned with a helmet of mud
He wears it well
He wears it as a king wears the ermine that bores him
He has set a new style in clothing
He has introduced the chic of mud


This is the song of the mud that wriggles its way into battle
The impertinent the intrusive the ubiquitous the unwelcome
The slimy inveterate nuisance
That fills the trenches
That mixes in with the food of the soldiers
That spoils the working of motors and crawls into their secret parts
That spreads itself over the guns
That sucks the guns down and holds them fast in its slimy voluminous lips
That has no respect for destruction and muzzles the bursting shells
And slowly softly easily
Soaks up the fire the noise soaks up the energy and the courage
Soaks up the power of armies
Soaks up the battle
Just soaks it up and thus stops it


This is the hymn of mud-the obscene the filthy the putrid
The vast liquid grave of our armies It has drowned our men
Its monstrous distended belly reeks with the undigested dead
Our men have gone into it sinking slowly and struggling and slowly disappearing
Our fine men our brave strong young men
Our glowing red shouting brawny men
Slowly inch by inch they have gone down into it
Into its darkness its thickness its silence
Slowly irresistibly it drew them down sucked them down
And they were drowned in thick bitter heaving mud
Now it hides them Oh so many of them
Under its smooth glistening surface it is hiding them blandly
There is not a trace of them
There is no mark where they went down
The mute enormous mouth of the mud has closed over them


This is the song of the mud
The beautiful glistening golden mud that covers the hills like satin
The mysterious gleaming silvery mud that is spread like enamel over the valleys
Mud the disguise of the war zone
Mud the mantle of battles
Mud the smooth fluid grave of our soldiers
This is the song of the mud"
Arthur SymonsAt the Three Fountains"Here where God lives among the trees
Where birds and monks the whole day sing
His praises in a pleasant ease

O heart might we not find a home
Here after all our wandering
These gates are closed even on Rome

Souls of the twilight wander here
Here in the garden of that death
Which was for loves sake need we fear

How sharp with bitter joy might be
Loves lingering last longed-for breath
Shut in upon eternity"

Oliver de la PazAt the Time of My Birth"I wondered how long I could go on
once the rain had stopped My nerves

were wedged like wings under a hat
Corncobs bobbed in boiling water I kept

a fist in my mouth I was strident
The neat house curved like a draining sink

Hot cars shined outside Their engines
snapped like a chamois I never

wanted to leave The streets were suet-thick
The hucksters had tinny voices They had

swollen drums They had gravel underfoot
and tongues that could peel citrus

Radios throbbed The wet hush
of my breath flung itself to mother

The soft dark skin The sweet
curl of the arm The hum"

where the unknown soldier did not die
This is the field where grass joined hands
where no monument stands

Birds fly here without any sound
unfolding their wings across the open
No people killed—or were killed—on this ground
hallowed by neglect and an air so tame
that people celebrate it by forgetting its name"

I’m reading the letters of Mr Nguyen Van The

Dinh Thuy Trang when she escaped by boat…
In the blue of his sentences a boat leaves Vietnam
on October   ventures into the South China Sea
and drifts dangerously along the coast of Thailand
I can just make out the boat a small open “v”
drawing its wake pattern on the sea in the letters
Around  AM of  October the boat was surrounded
by  fishing boats belonging to the Thai fishermen
I recoil at the actions his apt verbs dramatize—
invaded searched ransacked pried looked seized

George BilgereAt the Vietnam Memorial"The last time I saw Paul Castle
it was printed in gold on the wall
above the showers in the boys’
locker room next to the school
record for the mile I don’t recall
his time but the year was 
and I can look across the infield
of memory to see him on the track
legs flashing body bending slightly
beyond the pack of runners at his back

He couldn’t spare a word for me
two years younger junior varsity
and hardly worth the waste of breath
He owned the hallways a cool blonde
at his side and aimed his interests
further down the line than we could guess

Now reading the name again
I see us standing in the showers
naked kids beneath his larger
comprehensive force—the ones who trail
obscurely in the wake of the swift
like my shadow on this gleaming wall"

Fast you ever fast bind

Then let the March tread our ears
I to him turn with tears
Who to wedlock his wonder wedlock
Déals tríumph and immortal years"

Spencer ReeceAt Thomas Merton’s Grave"We can never be with loss too long
Behind the warped door that sticks
the wood thrush calls to the monks
pausing upon the stone crucifix
singing “I am marvelous alone”
Thrash thrash goes the hayfield
rows of marrow and bone undone
The horizon’s flashing fastens tight
sealing the blue hills with vermilion
Moss dyes a squirrel’s skull green
The cemetery expands its borders—
little milky crosses grow like teeth
How kind time is altering space
so nothing stays wrong and light
more new light always arrives"
Amy FleuryAt Twenty-Eight"It seems I get by on more luck than sense
not the kind brought on by knuckle to wood
breath on dice or pennies found in the mud
I shimmy and slip by on pure fool chance
At turns charmed and cursed a girl knows romance
as coffee red wine and books solitude
she counts as daylight virtue and muted
evenings the inventory of absence
But this is no sorry spinster story
just the way days string together a life
Sometimes I eat soup right out of the pan
Sometimes I don’t care if I will marry
I dance in my kitchen on Friday nights
singing like only a lucky girl can"

all my life What the Mexicans call poncho
At twilight I see it abandoned hanging like a ghost

next to gray speckled chickens pecking at roots

Cesare PaveseAtlantic Oil"The drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch
From the tavern five minutes through the dark field
and you’re home But first there’s the cool grass
to enjoy and the mechanic will sleep here till dawn
A few feet away the red and black sign that rises
from the field if you’re too close you can’t read it
it’s that big At this hour it’s still wet dew
Later the streets will cover it with dust as it covers
the bushes The mechanic beneath it stretches in sleep

Silence is total Shortly in the warmth of the sun
one car after another will pass waking the dust
At the top of the hill they slow down for the curve
then plunge down the slope A few of the cars
stop at the garage in the dust to drink a few liters
At this time of the morning the mechanics still dazed
will be sitting on oil drums waiting for work
It’s a pleasure to spend the morning sitting in the shade
where the stink of oil’s cut with the smell of green
of tobacco of wine and where work comes to them
right to the door Sometimes it’s even amusing
peasants’ wives come to scold them blaming the garage
for the traffic—it frightens the animals and women—
and for making their husbands look sullen quick trips
down the hill into Turin that lighten their wallets
Between laughing and selling gas one of them will pause
these fields it’s plain to see are covered with road dust
if you try to sit on the grass it’ll drive you away
On the hillside there’s a vineyard he prefers to all others
and in the end he’ll marry that vineyard and the sweet girl
who comes with it and he’ll go out in the sun to work
but now with a hoe and his neck will turn brown
and he’ll drink wine pressed on fall evenings from his own grapes

Cars pass during the night too but more quietly
so quiet the drunk in the ditch hasn’t woken At night
they don’t raise much dust and the beams of their headlights
as they round the curve reveal in full the sign in the field
Near dawn they glide cautiously along you can’t hear a thing
except maybe the breeze and from the top of the hill
they disappear into the plain sinking in shadows"
Terisa SiagatonuAtlas"If you open up any atlas
and take a look at a map of the world
almost every single one of them
slices the Pacific Ocean in half
To the human eye
every map centers all the land masses on Earth
creating the illusion
that water can handle the butchering
and be pushed to the edges
of the world
As if the Pacific Ocean isn’t the largest body
living today beating the loudest heart
the reason why land has a pulse in the first place

The audacity one must have to create a visual so
violent as to assume that no one comes
from water so no one will care
what you do with it
and yet
people came from land
are still coming from land
and look what was done to them

When people ask me where I’m from
they don’t believe me when I say water
So instead I tell them that home is a machete
and that I belong to places
that don’t belong to themselves anymore
broken and butchered places that have made me
a hyphen of a woman
a Samoan-American that carries the weight of both
colonizer and colonized
both blade and blood

California             stolen
Samoa
sliced in half
stolen
California nestled on the western coast of the most powerful
country on this planet
Samoa an island so microscopic on a map it’s no wonder
people doubt its existence
California a state of emergency away from having the drought
rid it of all its water
Samoa a state of emergency away from becoming a saltwater cemetery
if the sea level doesn’t stop rising
When people ask me where I’m from
what they want is to hear me speak of land
what they want is to know where I go once I leave here
the privilege that comes with assuming that home
is just a destination and not the panic
Not the constant migration that the panic gives birth to
What is it like To know that home is something
that’s waiting for you to return to it
What does it mean to belong to something that isn’t sinking
What does it mean to belong to what is causing the flood

So many of us come from water
but when you come from water
no one believes you
Colonization keeps laughing
Global warming is grinning
at all your grief
How you mourn the loss of a home
that isn’t even gone yet
That no one believes you’re from

How everyone is beginning
to hear more about your island
but only in the context of
vacations and honeymoons
football and military life
exotic women exotic fruit exotic beaches
but never asks about the rest of its body
The water
The islands breathing in it
The reason why they’re sinking
No one visualizes islands in the Pacific
as actually being there
You explain and explain and clarify
and correct their incorrect pronunciation
and explain

until they remember just how vast your ocean is
how microscopic your islands look in it
how easy it is to miss when looking
on a map of the world

Excuses people make
for why they didn’t see it
before"

Susan HuttonAtmospherics"Sometimes on a late clear night you can pull that station from Denver
or Boston out of the dark

All the elsewheres alter here as what you remember

Out there in the dark the true thing"
Jennifer MoxleyThe Atrophy of Private LIfe"In the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word “money” but you assuming no one wants you anymore mishear the message as “meaning” Arousal follows The lives of the rich are so fabulous The destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands as on their swollen notion that we are always watching There is nothing behind the mask Nothing suffocating under its pressure no human essence trying to get out
Awareness always awareness Don’t you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie The private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior It is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line Nobody least of all the future cares about the outcome of this quest
It is easy to lose through meddling or neglect an entire aspect of existence And sometimes to cultivate a single new thought you need not only silence but an entirely new life"
Siegfried SassoonAttack"At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun

In the wild purple of the glowring sun

Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud

The menacing scarred slope and one by one

Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire

The barrage roars and lifts Then clumsily bowed

With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear

Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire

Lines of grey muttering faces masked with fear

They leave their trenches going over the top

While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists

And hope with furtive eyes and grappling fists

Flounders in mud O Jesus make it stop"

making blue snow grow at the windows
mohair fumes clog my throat like cats
flames pounce without burning
shadows gather in parkas at my back
turn so i can see your face
stand where i can see you man
should someone phone
i will tell whoever it is
i cannot escape this night
even saxophones do not dry
light the brown sweat
terror in white doorways
under multicolored covers
there is no way to sleep
with the phone
falling off the hook
the blaring beep of warnings
do not leave your house
do not stay home
this is the contradiction
of when i live
even fanfares and flourishes
do not announce a truce
with our personal assailants
without variety blue dust
blood traces in floor wax
black fog and nappy lint
colorless wax spreads broad
tears across all the windows
some permanent weather
happened to this building
some misplaced coal mine
had its disaster here
and i am alive inside"
Sarah LindsayAttack Underground"Themiscyra  BC
While Lucullus raided cherry orchards
he left us to besiege
grudgingly this outlander fortress
named for an Amazon queen
while thinking of food and home
Not one of us has seen
a single horse-borne warrior woman
Meanwhile we dug a tomb

We intended it as the tunnel
through which we’d claim the fort
We shored up the sifting roof
and dug by lamps
that shed more shadows than light
At last we formed up underground
to attack with sword and fire
but the enemy tossed in hives

and in a cloud of stinging bees
our torches jerked and swung or fell
so we could hardly tell
where to strike or what for next
our enemy sent weasels in and foxes
which seemed to be done in jest
until we felt their teeth
and heard more than saw the larger beasts

A wolf  began my death
I lay in men’s and weasels’ blood
and heard the body
that dropped at my side
askWhat barbarian thought to make
of thoughtless creatures weapons of war"
Valzhyna MortAn Attempt at Genealogy"


Where am I from

In black basilicas
dragged incessantly
down a cross
is a man
who here resembles
a dress
snatched from a hanger

there thick clouds of muscles —
an overcast body —

embodied weather
of one hardly-known country

A country where I am from

Dragging him
they stick their hands under his armpits
How cozy their hands are
in such a warm place


Through a cut in his chest
Eve watches
with her one bloody eye

Of a cut in the chest — a red eyelash

But
where am I from





Yes a man
resembles
a dress
snatched from a hanger


Inside black
alphabet

dragged incessantly down
each letter
is a man





To a telephone in a long hallway
as if to a well for water
Well where am I from

Neither mama’s
nor papa’s
my round face
takes after
a rotary phone

A rotary phone is my gene pool
My body rings as it runs
to put my head
on the strong shoulder of the receiver

Blood is talking Blood connection is weak
Inside the receiver I hear crackle
as if fire were calling
Who is this

It’s me fire receiver

But where am I from





Days of merciless snow behind the kitchen window —
snow got deposited like fat under our skin

How large we’ve grown on those days
So much time spent at the kitchen table
trying to decide where to put commas
in sentences about made-up lives

yet no one bothered to tell us
that words uttered once
crowd in the brain like in a hospital lobby

That time is supposed to heal
only because once
it was seen with a scalpel in its hands

You’ve made a mistake you’d say mysteriously
pointing at lines written by a child Think

of another word with the same root
As if words can have roots

As if words didn’t come from darkness
cat-in-the-bag words
as if our human roots were already

known to us

Here’s Grammar here’s Orthography
here’s a paper rag “bread milk butter”
What roots What morphology What rules

of subjugation How is it even possible

to make a mistake Here’s PhysicsChemistry
Geometry with its atlas now

where are Vaclav’s letters



What to do about the etymology of us
Our etymology


 crowds my hospital lobby

The face of a rotary phone
the face of a clock
the face of a radio on the wall —
these are my
round-faced
progenitors
But Vaclav’s face —

where

Again a man
resembles
a dress snatched from a hanger

And where are the letters One
per week in his best Sunday
handwriting

Inside the receiver — fire
How cozy are my ears in such a warm place
But where am I from





A postwar city barracks —
the joy of a first apartment —

a coat a jacket a leather purse
fat with pills but where are
the where-letters
from the where-face

Evacuated face
de-evacuated face
sick not sick stuck through face
vacuum face
lab rat face

This country was tested on Vaclav’s face
Now we can live in peace

So
where am I from

A postwar city barracks —
the joy

of a deactivated face

vacated face

A face snatched from a hanger
Absence as an inner organ





In a village known for a large puddle
where all children fall between the two categories

of those who hurt the living things
and those who hurt the nonliving things

in a village known
for being unknown
where am I from
a graveyard around an old church
the frightening alphabet
around the village
an alphabet on gravestones
marble letters under the moth-eaten snow

Under the moth-eaten snow
my motherland has good bones





My motherland rattles its bone-keys
A bone is a key to my motherland





My motherland rattles its bone-keys
Eve watches with her one red eyelash

Under the moth-eaten snow
my motherland has good bones

In my motherland people kneel before wells
In my motherland people pray to the crosses of flying birds

A bone is a key to my people

Among my people only the dead
have human faces

Still
where am I from





Women saints in berets of golden threads
who are they by your feet seated like pets

An angel with wings of a peacock
an angel with a human face
But
who are they by your feet

seated like pets


Now if you wear such golden berets
if you tame children and angels
if your white boneless fingers leaf through a book
while I gnaw
on this wooden verse


would you holy women who wear golden berets
put the hairs on my tongue

into a pigtail






A mouse-tail of a word for a word-loving rodent

Inside my alphabet
dragged incessantly down
each frightening letter
is a man

My frightening alphabet in his best Sunday
handwriting


A letter addressed to lost letters
phone-face clock-face radio-face —
face as an inner organ


Where are Vaclav’s letters
as an inner organ


On the borderlines of my motherland
— wet laundry claps in the wind like gunfire


Have you heard of my motherland

My motherland is a raw yolk inside a Fabergé egg
This yolk is what gives gold its color

This face is a fire-receiver
This face is an inner organ
A bone as a key to my people

Where am I from





The golden bones of my motherland are ringing"

  “An Attempt at Jealousy”""How is your life with that other one
Simpler is it A stroke of the oars
and a long coastline—
and the memory of me

is soon a drifting island
not in the ocean—in the sky
Souls—you will be sisters—
sisters not lovers

How is your life with an ordinary
woman without the god inside her
The queen supplanted—

How do you breathe now
Flinch waking up
What do you do poor man

“Hysterics and interruptions—
enough I’ll rent my own house”
How is your life with that other
you my own

Is the breakfast delicious
If you get sick don’t blame me
How is it living with a postcard
You who stood on Sinai

How’s your life with a tourist
on Earth Her rib do you love her
is it to your liking

How’s life Do you cough
Do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind

How do you live with cheap goods is the market rising
How’s kissing plaster-dust

Are you bored with her new body
How’s it going with an earthly woman
with no sixth sense

Are you happy
No In a shallow pit—how is your life
my beloved Hard as mine
with another man

"
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagallAttempted Assassination of the Queen"God prosper long our noble Queen
And long may she reign
Maclean he tried to shoot her
But it was all in vain

For God He turned the ball aside
Maclean aimed at her head
And he felt very angry
Because he didn’t shoot her dead

There’s a divinity that hedges a king
And so it does seem
And my opinion is it has hedged
Our most gracious Queen

Maclean must be a madman
Which is obvious to be seen
Or else he wouldn’t have tried to shoot
Our most beloved Queen

Victoria is a good Queen
Which all her subjects know
And for that God has protected her
From all her deadly foes

She is noble and generous
Her subjects must confess
There hasn’t been her equal
Since the days of good Queen Bess

Long may she be spared to roam
Among the bonnie Highland floral
And spend many a happy day
In the palace of Balmoral

Because she is very kind
To the old women there
And allows them bread tea and sugar
And each one to get a share

And when they know of her coming
Their hearts feel overjoy’d
Because in general she finds work
For men that’s unemploy’d

And she also gives the gipsies money
While at Balmoral I’ve been told
And mind ye seldom silver
But very often gold

I hope God will protect her
By night and by day
At home and abroad
When she’s far away

May He be as a hedge around her
As He’s been all along
And let her live and die in peace
Is the end of my song"

Solstice Boulder Colorado 
High Park fires distress"
Cynthia HuntingtonThe Attic"It’s September I’ve moved into town
into the attic of an old barn—a big open room I reach
by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor
The room is long and high with windows at each end
a row of skylights that leak rain and shake
and chatter in the northeast winds I sleep beneath
the roof’s steep pitch my mattress flat on the boards
looking up at the high ceiling where morning
diffuses downward in grains of bright dust

This was the old painter’s studio
The light in those famous canvases is still here
—he couldn’t carry it away with him—
though his paintings took away everything else
opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow
I think of his violent loves the stories
they still tell about him here
But how quiet and alive his paintings were
how they quiver with the life not yet realized

The town is quiet in September
Sometimes I hear people talking in the street
Last night someone said they were going to wait for Michael
and a voice said that Michael had gone home
I walk the narrow path down to the marsh
Wind hard in the dunes Rain as I’m returning
cutting through twisting streets past gardens bent
low with rain their colors a wash of gold

I feel the air surround my body feel it move
between my legs and between each finger
as I walk not mastering space but in it
And when the clouds open the sky
suddenly wide and high no roof of leaves
it seems there’s nowhere to go but into wind or water
I climb the narrow stairs that keep turning
twisting inward until they meet the ceiling
which opens and I rise through the floor
released into an openness I never learn to expect

At the yellow table I sit and read
an interview with Picasso’s lover Francoise Gilot
the only one to leave him and have another life
She says she was not destroyed by him as the others were
“Because I am of the stuff that cannot be destroyed”
I felt something blow through me then
Some devouring wind Surely then
I am of the stuff that can be destroyed
Haven’t I felt it The breaking of all I was
Don’t I sit and count my losses
here in this room where all the life I knew has ended
so bare with desire I seem to be eating sky

That’s how it is here I’m lonely sad
the wind blows along the roof and I can’t sleep
Rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor
leaving dirty puddles on the boards
A yellow table and a cupboard painted blue
three chairs that dont match or even balance rightly
a dented bucket its metal reflecting darkly
what is what cannot be taken away
What’s beautiful here The whole thing
is beauty a clarity not in things
but around them complete And still

I seem to remain somehow myself
to remain at least something at a loss
to know how much can be taken from me
and leave me only changed not ruined
alert in an emptiness so alive
I recognized it as my life What would be left
the shape of it then this life I said some beauty
or radiance an endless space I fall into
or am taken up by a brightness that holds me
gathers light in the center of empty space
like a vision of the life I have not lived"
Richard AldingtonAu Vieux Jardin"I have sat here happy in the gardens
Watching the still pool and the reeds
And the dark clouds
Which the wind of the upper air
Tore like the green leafy boughs
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer
But though I greatly delight
In these and the water-lilies
That which sets me nighest to weeping
Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones
And the pale yellow grasses
Among them"
Dore KiesselbachAubade"“Take me with you”
my mother says
standing in her nightgown
as home from college
I prepare to leave
before dawn
The desolation
she must face
was once my concern
but like a bobber
pulled beneath
the surface
by an inedible fish
she vanished
into the life
he offered her
It stopped occurring
to me she might return
“I’ll be back” I say
and then I go"
Dafydd ap GwilymAubade"It seemed as if we did not sleep
One wink that night I was sighing deep
The cruellest judge in the costliest court
Could not condemn a night so short
We had the light out but I know
Each time I turned a radiant glow
Suffused the room and shining snow
Alit from Heaven’s candle-fires
Illuminated our desires

But the last time I held her strong
Excited closest very long
Something started to go wrong
The edge of dawn’s despotic veil
Showed at the eastern window-pale
And there it was—the morning light
Gwen was seized with a fearful fright
Became an apparition cried
“Get up go now with God go hide

“Love is a salt a gall a rue
A vinegar-vintageDos y Ddw
Vaya con Dios quickly too”
“Ah not yet never yet my love
The stars and moon still shine above”
“Then why do the raucous ravens talk
With such a loud insistent squawk”
“Crows always cry like that when fleas
Nibble their ankles nip their knees”

“And why do the dogs yip yammer yell”
“They think they’ve caught a fox’s smell”
“Poet the wisdom of a fool
Offers poor counsel as a rule
Open the door open it wide
As fast as you can and leap outside
The dogs are fierce when they get untied”
“The woods are only a bound from here
And I can outjump a deer my dear”

“But tell me best beloved of men
Will you come again Will you come again”
“Gwen you know I’m your nightingale
And I’ll be with you without fail
When the cloud is cloak and the dark is sky
And when the night comes so will I”"
Tom SleighAubade﻿"Lathe of the ocean Perpetual
Motion machine of the waves Everything still
Being turned and shaped to a shape nobody
Foresees Ten years ago was it when we

Walked that shore too earnest and sheepish
To hold hands The wind cutting through our clothes
Cleansed and burned the chill off the Atlantic
An ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk

Callow expectant what wouldn’t love give
Cavalcanti’s ray from Mars Dante’s wheel that moves
The planets and the stars how nervous
We were awkward and shivering “Like this

Do you like it like this” Up all night
Then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat
We lay grateful winded goosefleshed in the chill
Our own atmosphere rich and breathable

We drank round the clock embracing extremes
Too hurried and heartsore to think of time…
Out fishing after midnight we watched schools of squid
Slide and shimmer tentacles tight-wrapped

Around our gig’s hooks Yanked from the water
They spouted jets of ink then pulsed and quivered
And faded to dead-white their eyes resigned and sober
Opening wider and wider…Ten years more

And will either of us remember
That ink sticky on our hands the moon-glare
Rippling as we knelt underneath the pier
And scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water
"
Garrett CaplesAubade"for Andrew Joron
the desire to show is destruction
in lessons forgot before learned
no shrunken heads hang by wires
no mourning songs of half-remembered
shutters open the width of an eyelash
it is enough for vision to run
its finger along for access to steal
from forbidden shores the still-cold
beams of night and pack them in ice
but a child couldn’t live here nonetheless

in the morning is come a bell that summons
a fortune that reads she will soon
cross the water and the intended instructions
which may not florish after all
she leaves a painting outside her room
and in the morning it’s gone
and not one word is spoke between them
but her father carries it to his grave
the desire to show is destruction
and we are not hung with skins
we must follow internal echoes
commit ourselves to memory"
Philip LarkinAubade"I work all day and get half-drunk at night
Waking at four to soundless dark I stare
In time the curtain-edges will grow light
Till then I see what’s really always there
Unresting death a whole day nearer now
Making all thought impossible but how
And where and when I shall myself die
Arid interrogation yet the dread
Of dying and being dead
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify

The mind blanks at the glare Not in remorse
—The good not done the love not given time
Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because
An only life can take so long to climb
Clear of its wrong beginnings and may never
But at the total emptiness for ever
The sure extinction that we travel to
And shall be lost in always Not to be here
Not to be anywhere
And soon nothing more terrible nothing more true

This is a special way of being afraid
No trick dispels Religion used to try
That vast moth-eaten musical brocade
Created to pretend we never die
And specious stuff that says No rational being
Can fear a thing it will not feel not seeing
That this is what we fear—no sight no sound
No touch or taste or smell nothing to think with
Nothing to love or link with
The anaesthetic from which none come round

And so it stays just on the edge of vision
A small unfocused blur a standing chill
That slows each impulse down to indecision
Most things may never happen this one will
And realisation of it rages out
In furnace-fear when we are caught without
People or drink Courage is no good
It means not scaring others Being brave
Lets no one off the grave
Death is no different whined at than withstood

Slowly light strengthens and the room takes shape
It stands plain as a wardrobe what we know
Have always known know that we can’t escape
Yet can’t accept One side will have to go
Meanwhile telephones crouch getting ready to ring
In locked-up offices and all the uncaring
Intricate rented world begins to rouse
The sky is white as clay with no sun
Work has to be done
Postmen like doctors go from house to house"
Rick BarotAubade"Scintillas of the anatomical

Amber Flora ThomasAubade"I know my leaving in the breakfast table mess
Bowl spills into bowl milk and bran bread crust
crumbled You push me back into bed

More “honey” and “baby”
Breath you tell my ear circles inside me
curls a damp wind and runs the circuit
of my limbs I interrogate the air

smell Murphy’s Oil Soap dog kibble
No rose No patchouli swelter And your mouth—
sesame olive The nudge of your tongue
behind my top teeth

To entirely finish is water entering water
Which is the cup I take away

More turning me Less your arms reaching
around my back You ask my ear
where I have been and my body answers
all over kingdom come"
David MuraAubade"A wound is a blossom
but only to the living
A May night birdsong

before the first light pierces
chirps out of blackness
My daughters angry at me

and her mother as I
was once angry at mine
Its a way of crossing over

Im so tired now
And my cores
all water flowing

somewhere where the sea
cant find her And neither
can I How much longer

till I finally lose her Where
is the first dawn wet blossom
Who recalls how I touched

her mother once Or many others
How night is not always easy
Nor are daughters Nor are sons

And how is it Ive become a father
watching light sift slowly
into the daughterless dark"
Joel BrouwerAn Aubade"She said what about San Francisco Another
second chance There would be bridges ""shrouded
in fog"" Streets ""pregnant and glowing"" with traffic
Dawn she didnt know would maybe ""draw near""
He said dawn draws near everywhere She said
a city but a city close to nature A backyard
scattered with birds he wouldnt be able to identify
and something exotic rotting Avocadoes
Theyd play a game on the bridge shed lose
control of the car hed kick her foot away
and mash the gas pedal to the floor until she
screamed and theyd have a name for the game
and later it would be a story for their kids if
they had any kids later But no city is close to nature
Her body is a white slash beneath the green sheet
Or ""a sterilized instrument"" Last nights wine dregs
are both ""the color of the valley as it ignites""
and in fact that color He pulls the sheets from her
again and says hell cut their coffins from
a wazihcaka even if it leaves a gray jay homeless
The lumbers astringency Fuck guacamole
Deep in her knots and sap Faster and faster Second
nature And now a different dawn drawing near"
Tarfia FaizullahAubade Ending with the Death of a Mosquito"—at Apollo Hospital Dhaka
Let me break
free of these lace-frail
lilac fingers disrobing
the black sky
from the windows of this
room I sit helpless waiting
silent—sister
because you drew from me
the coil of red twine loneliness—
spooled inside—
once I wanted to say one
true thing as in I want more
in this"
Thomas MertonAubade-Harlem"for Baroness G de Hueck
Across the cages of the keyless aviaries
The lines and wires the gallows of the broken kites
Crucify against the fearful light
The ragged dresses of the little children
Soon in the sterile jungles of the waterpipes and ladders
The bleeding sun a bird of prey will terrify the poor
These will forget the unbelievable moon

But in the cells of whiter buildings
Where the glass dawn is brighter than the knives of surgeons
Paler than alcohol or ether shinier than money
The white men’s wives like Pilate’s
Cry in the peril of their frozen dreams

“Daylight has driven iron spikes
Into the flesh of Jesus’ hands and feet
Four flowers of blood have nailed Him to the walls of Harlem”

Along the white halls of the clinics and the hospitals
Pilate evaporates with a cry
They have cut down two hundred Judases
Hanged by the neck in the opera houses and the museum

Across the cages of the keyless aviaries
The lines and wires the gallows of the broken kites
Crucify against the fearful light
The ragged dresses of the little children"
Oliver de la PazAubade with Bread for the Sparrows"The snow voids the distance of the road
and the first breath comes from the early morning
ghosts The sparrows with their hard eyes
glisten in the difficult light They preen
their feathers and chirp It’s as though they were one
voice talking to God
Mornings are a sustained hymn
without the precision of faith You’ve turned the bag
filled with molding bread inside out and watch
the old crusts fall to the ice What’s left
but to watch the daylight halved by the glistening ground
What’s left but an empty bag and the dust of bread
ravaged by songsters
There are ruins we witness
within the moment of the world’s first awakening
and the birds love you within that moment They want
to eat the air and the stars they’ve hungered for little razors

Little urgent bells the birds steal from each other’s mouths
which makes you hurt Don’t ask for more bread
The world is in haste to waken Don’t ask for a name
you can surrender for there are more ghosts to placate
Don’t hurt for the sparrows for they love you like a road"

Martín EspadaAubade with Concussion"Poverty is black ice
— Naomi Ayala
You leave me sleeping in the dark You kiss me and I stir
fingers in your hair eyes open unseeing You leave me asleep
every morning commuting to the school in the city at sunrise

The landlord’s driveway a muddy creek ices over hard after
the freezing rain clatters all night Your feet fly up your head
slamming the ground an eclipse of the sun flooding your eyes
You sleep under the car No one knows how long you sleep

You awake with a hundred ice picks stabbing your eardrums
You awake coat and hair soaked and somehow drive to school
You remember to turn left at the Smith amp Wesson factory
The other teachers lead you by the elbow to Mercy Hospital
where you pause when the nurse asks your name where you claim
your pain level is a four and they slide you into the white coffin
of an MRI machine You hold your breath They film your brain

Concussion the word we use for the boxer plunging face-first
to the canvas after the uppercut blindsided him not the teacher
commuting to school at sunrise in a Subaru Crosstrek Yet you would
drive ears hammering as they hammer in the purgatory of the MRI

A week before Isabela came to you in the classroom and said
Miss I cannot sleep Three days I cannot sleep Her boyfriend called
at 
am
 and she did not pick up At 
am
 a single shot to the head
put him to sleep and he will sleep forever his body hidden beneath
a car in a parking lot on Maple Street the cops the television cameras
the neighbors all gathering at the yellow-tape carnival of his corpse

You said to IsabelaTake this journal Write it down You don’t have
to show me You don’t have to show anyone On the cover of the journal
you bought at the drugstore was the wordDream Isabela sat there
in your classroom at your desk pencil waving in furious circles
By lunchtime as her friends slapped each other Isabela slept
head on the desk face pressed against the pages of the journal

This is why I watch you sleep at 
am
 when the sleeping pills fail
to quell the strike meeting in my brain This is why I say to you
when you kiss me in my sleepDon’t go Don’t go You have to go"

Stephen SpenderAudens Funeral"I
One among friends who stood above your grave
I cast a clod of earth from those heaped there
Down on the great brass-handled coffin lid
It rattled on the oak like a door knocker
And at that sound I saw your face beneath
Wedged in an oblong shadow under ground
Flesh creased eyes shut jaw jutting
And on the mouth a grin triumph of one
Who has escaped from life-long colleagues roaring
For him to join their throng Hes still half with us
Conniving slyly yet he knows hes gone
Into that cellar where theyll never find him
Happy to be alone his last work done
Word freed from world into a different wood

But we with feet on grass feeling the wind
Whip blood up in our cheeks walk back along
The hillside road we earlier climbed today
Following the hearse and tinkling village band
The white October sun circles Kirchstetten
With colours of chrysanthemums in gardens
And bronze and golden under wiry boughs
A few last apples gleam like jewels
Back in the village inn we sit on benches
For the last toast to you the honoured ghost
Whose absence now becomes incarnate in us
Tasting the meats we imitate your voice
Speaking in flat benign objective tones
The night before you died In the packed hall
You are your words Your listeners see
Written on your face the poems they hear
Like letters carved in a trees bark
The sight and sound of solitudes endured
And looking down on them you see
Your image echoed in their eyes
Enchanted by your language to be theirs
And then your last word said halloing hands
Hold up above their heads your farewell bow
Then many stomp the platform entreating
Each for his horde your still warm signing hand
But you have hidden away in your hotel
And locked the door and lain down on the bed
And fallen from their praise dead on the floor

Ghost of a ghost of you when young you waken
In me my ghost when young us both at Oxford
You the tow-haired undergraduate
With jaunty liftings of the head
Angular forward stride cross-questioning glance
A Buster Keaton-faced pale gravitas
Saying aloud your poems whose letters bit
Ink-deep into my fingers when I set
Them up upon my five-pound printing press

An evening like a coloured photograph

A music stultified across the water

The heel upon the finishing blade of grass"
Rachel RichardsonAudubon at Oakley Plantation"I need them true to life
and so I shoot them
as many as fill the field at dawn
and then fix wires
to prop them as if feeding their young
or bending to the river

Why make a little book
when they exist life-sized
can be etched to stand high as my hip
Often have I wished
I had eight pairs of hands to hold them
and another body for the gun"
Kevin ColeAudubon Warblers"The Audubon warblers keep the time of their coming
Arriving on stillness of a storm
Their breast and backs as dark as low bruised banks of cloud
Rumps and throats as yellow as blooms of buckwheat

They throng this evening in the newly-leaved
Tender-tipped canopies nervously weaving
Through the catkins like frantic prophets
Bearing some divine prophecy of the coming spring

I wait hoping for nothing too grave
News of ruinous lands of cutting and swarming locusts
Of withering vines and empty granaries
Of fasting weeping and rending of garments

No I wait for lighter fare
Perhaps a promise that the green heron will nest
On the west end of the slough and that the ironweed
And wood lily will once again together bloom

This would be an ample prophecy for another year—
This and a promise to keep the time of their coming"
CAConradAuguries Cast Aside"to enter the sky with our bodies
the principal concern for

no one taught me this
any more than they taught me
to say good morning to my hippocampus
but I do because I love my hippocampus
I was in a band one summer
we never could harmonize
we smiled and kept playing
we loved our united disunity
a wild stubborn focus
chewing its way out
how awkward the
archer after
shooting
his arrow
remembering
first time getting
into bed just
for sex
they say
I’m old now
ask my advice
all I have to offer is
make as many mistakes
as you can handle but make
them as soon as possible
oh and don’t waste time
following each other from
opposite sides of the river
when storm blows wig
off my head it simply
means it is time to let
the storm take its share"
William BlakeAuguries of Innocence"To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour
A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage
A Dove house filld with Doves amp Pigeons
Shudders Hell thr all its regions
A dog starvd at his Masters Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State
A Horse misusd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human blood
Each outcry of the hunted Hare
A fibre from the Brain does tear
A Skylark wounded in the wing
A Cherubim does cease to sing
The Game Cock clipd amp armd for fight
Does the Rising Sun affright
Every Wolfs amp Lions howl
Raises from Hell a Human Soul
The wild deer wandring here amp there
Keeps the Human Soul from Care
The Lamb misusd breeds Public Strife
And yet forgives the Butchers knife
The Bat that flits at close of Eve
Has left the Brain that wont Believe
The Owl that calls upon the Night
Speaks the Unbelievers fright
He who shall hurt the little Wren
Shall never be belovd by Men
He who the Ox to wrath has movd
Shall never be by Woman lovd
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
Shall feel the Spiders enmity
He who torments the Chafers Sprite
Weaves a Bower in endless Night
The Catterpiller on the Leaf
Repeats to thee thy Mothers grief
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly
For the Last Judgment draweth nigh
He who shall train the Horse to War
Shall never pass the Polar Bar

Feed them amp thou wilt grow fat
The Gnat that sings his Summers Song
Poison gets from Slanders tongue
The poison of the Snake amp Newt
Is the sweat of Envys Foot
The poison of the Honey Bee
Is the Artists Jealousy
The Princes Robes amp Beggars Rags
Are Toadstools on the Misers Bags
A Truth thats told with bad intent
Beats all the Lies you can invent
It is right it should be so
Man was made for Joy amp Woe
And when this we rightly know
Thro the World we safely go
Joy amp Woe are woven fine
A Clothing for the soul divine
Under every grief amp pine
Runs a joy with silken twine
The Babe is more than swadling Bands
Throughout all these Human Lands
Tools were made amp Born were hands
Every Farmer Understands
Every Tear from Every Eye
Becomes a Babe in Eternity
This is caught by Females bright
And returnd to its own delight
The Bleat the Bark Bellow amp Roar
Are Waves that Beat on Heavens Shore
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
Writes Revenge in realms of Death
The Beggars Rags fluttering in Air
Does to Rags the Heavens tear
The Soldier armd with Sword amp Gun
Palsied strikes the Summers Sun
The poor Mans Farthing is worth more
Than all the Gold on Africs Shore
One Mite wrung from the Labrers hands
Shall buy amp sell the Misers Lands
Or if protected from on high
Does that whole Nation sell amp buy
He who mocks the Infants Faith
Shall be mockd in Age amp Death
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall neer get out
He who respects the Infants faith
Triumphs over Hell amp Death
The Childs Toys amp the Old Mans Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons
The Questioner who sits so sly
Shall never know how to Reply
He who replies to words of Doubt
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesars Laurel Crown
Nought can Deform the Human Race
Like to the Armours iron brace
When Gold amp Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow
A Riddle or the Crickets Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply
The Emmets Inch amp Eagles Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to smile
He who Doubts from what he sees
Will neer Believe do what you Please
If the Sun amp Moon should Doubt
Theyd immediately Go out
To be in a Passion you Good may Do
But no Good if a Passion is in you
The Whore amp Gambler by the State
Licencd build that Nations Fate
The Harlots cry from Street to Street
Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet
The Winners Shout the Losers Curse
Dance before dead Englands Hearse
Every Night amp every Morn
Some to Misery are Born
Every Morn and every Night
Some are Born to sweet delight
Some are Born to sweet delight
Some are Born to Endless Night
We are led to Believe a Lie
When we see not Thro the Eye
Which was Born in a Night to perish in a Night
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light
God Appears amp God is Light
To those poor Souls who dwell in Night
But does a Human Form Display
To those who Dwell in Realms of day"

a wormwood haze —
the “m” on its head
a “w” amazed
at what the
drink itself does

Vermouth

What really matters now is begonia
he thought distracted while reading —
their amber anther and bone-white petals
missing from a jade pot
by the door — not a theory of metaphor





In this corner sweet alyssum
And beside it fragrant jessamine

Almost rhyming scents in the air —
a syntax weaving their there there





Erodium holds
an eye in the pink
looping the white of
its tendering cup





The blue moon opens all
too quickly and floats
its head-
y fragrance over
the path
before us

And so we slit
its throat like a florist

Epistle-like chicory
blue beyond
the bars of these

way to plugged in

What’s a wandering
Jew to you
two who often do
wonder about
that moving about
Its purple stalk
torn-off and stuck
elsewhere in
the ground takes root
and soon shoots
forth a bluish
star with powder
on its pistil
Such is the power
of that Jew
wherever it goes
unlike the rose
to make itself new"
Twyla HansenAugust  in the Nebraska Sand Hills Watching the Perseids Meteor Shower"In the middle of rolling grasslands away from lights
a moonless night untethers its wild polka-dots
the formations we can name competing for attention
in a twinkling and crowded sky-bowl

Out from the corners our eyes detect a maverick meteor
a transient streak and lying back toward midnight
on the heft of car hood all conversation blunted
we are at once unnerved and somehow restored

Out here a furrow of spring-fed river threads
through ranches in the tens of thousands of acres
Like cattle we are powerless by instinct can see
why early people trembled and deliberated the heavens

Off in the distance those cattle make themselves known
a bird song moves singular across the horizon
Not yet  and bits of comet dust the Perseids
startle and skim the atmosphere like skipping stones

In the leaden dark we are utterly alone As I rub the ridges
on the back of your hand our love for all things warm
and pulsing crescendos toward dawn this timeless awe
your breath floating with mine upward into the stars"
May Wedderburn CannanAugust "The sun rose over the sweep of the hill
All bare for the gathered hay
And a blackbird sang by the window-sill
And a girl knelt down to pray
‘Whom Thou hast kept through the night O Lord
Keep Thou safe through the day’

The sun rose over the shell-swept height
The guns are over the way
And a soldier turned from the toil of the night
To the toil of another day
And a bullet sang by the parapet
To drive in the new-turned clay

The sun sank slow by the sweep of the hill
They had carried all the hay
And a blackbird sang by the window-sill
And a girl knelt down to pray
‘Keep Thou safe through the night O Lord
Whom Thou hast kept through the day’

The sun sank slow by the shell-swept height
The guns had prepared a way
And a soldier turned to sleep that night
Who would not wake for the day
And a blackbird flew from the window-sill
When a girl knelt down to pray"
Isaac RosenbergAugust "What in our lives is burnt
In the fire of this
The hearts dear granary
The much we shall miss

Three lives hath one life—
Iron honey gold
The gold the honey gone—
Left is the hard and cold

Iron are our lives
Molten right through our youth
A burnt space through ripe fields
A fair mouths broken tooth"
Vera Mary Brittain"August ""God said“Men have forgotten Me
The souls that sleep shall wake again
And blinded eyes must learn to see”

So since redemption comes through pain
He smote the earth with chastening rod
And brought destructions lurid reign

But where His desolation trod
The people in their agony
Despairing cried“There is no God”"
Jerzy Ficowski"August  ""In memory of   Janusz Korczak
What did the Old Doctor do
in a cattle car
riding to Treblinka on the th of August
over a few hours of   blood flow
over the dirty river of time

I do not know

What did Charon the volunteer do
ferryman without an oar
did he give the children the remains
of   his breath
and leave for himself
just the shiver in the bones

I do not know

Did he lie to them for instance
in small numbing
doses
picking from their sweaty heads
the skittish lice of   fear

I do not know

but for that but later but there
in Treblinka
all their terror all the tears
were against him

oh it was only
so many minutes a whole life
is that a lot or a little

I was not there I don’t know

suddenly the Old Doctor saw
the children become
old like him
older and older
they had to catch up to the grayness of  ash

then when he was hit
by an Askar or SS man
they saw how the Doctor
became a child like them
smaller and smaller
until he was not born

since then together with the Old Doctor
there are plenty of  them nowhere

Peter BalakianAugust Diary"/

From here groomed fields and clumps of trees
a silo of corrugated tin and a white barn blur

Unseasonable cool days
high blue a few clouds like ripped pillows
as if this were a lip of the North Sea

and I could look out and imagine Denmark
But I’m in my office three floors up


/

In Armenian there’s a word—garod—rhymes with “maud”

The beautiful ones are not faithful
and the faithful ones are not beautiful—

a student said that about some Pavese translations
here in my office

Should I tell you what garod means


/

What’s happening in Spitak and Sarajevo and the West Bank
is splayed like the cortex of a silicon chip in the fuzzy air

Maria the physician from Armenia was  amp had one plastic arm
and one real arm I met her in East Hampton on the deck of a house on the dunes
After the earthquake she had no husband
no parents and only one child

“I’m in a good mood today” she said “let’s talk about
something else” I poured her an Amstel Light


/

The coolness intrudes—
month of wind-sprints and retching for the coach
It comes back like nerve ends after surgery

Along a country road cicadas rattling
Chicory and sweet pea intruding on the ripe barley

I picked up some seed packs from a junk shop on Rt 
a tomato blazed in red ink/  Fredonia NY


/

What’s between us The red ink of the tomato

How does an image stay Or is it always aftermath
The way deep black reflected the most light in Talbot’s first calotypes

But garod tongue of a snake
meaning exile longing for home

Thomas Wedgwood got images by getting sunlight
to pass through things onto paper brushed with silver nitrate

wings of a dragonfly the spine of an oak leaf—
fugitive photograms But he couldn’t stop the sun
until it turned the paper black

Stop the light before it goes too far

Or is desire what garod means
Longing for a native place


/

Maria said she was learning how to connect nerve endings
in the hand so hands and arms would work again
There were so many in Armenia without working hands and arms

At the end of each dendrite is a blurred line
like the horizon I’m squinting

Image of the other
light-arrested not the image of ourselves


/

After digging scallions one day Dickinson defined freedom
Captivity’s consciousness so’s liberty

Maybe garod is about the longing for the native place
between two selves


/

I love the brute force of silence in Roger Fenton’s
Sebastopol from Cathcart’s Hill  The Crimean inner war

The artlessness of silver is like my tongue in your wet space
or like the news photos that bring us the pressure of disaster

Beloved topography
garod then must mean yearning

Is that how we loved under the rattling Nippon porcelain
in the light calotyped by the fire escape


/

garod the grain chute that spills
into a dark barn which is endless

like the self when it’s out of reach

Are we so lonely that a constellation
could blacken and fill up that same barn

and that be me or you

But still we’re piss and oats and stock in there
We’re like civet who wouldn’t love it

Carol Muske-Dukes"August Los Angeles Lullaby""The pure amnesia of her face
newborn I looked so far
into her that for a while

the visual held no memory
Little by little I returned
to myself waking to nurse

those first nights in that
familiar room where all
the objects had been altered

imperceptibly the gardenia
blooming in the dark
in the scarred water glass

near the phone my handwriting
illegible the patterned lamp-
shade angled downward and away

from the long mirror where
I stood and looked at
the woman holding her child

Her face kept dissolving
into expressions resembling
my own but the child’s was pure

figurative resembling no one
We floated together in the space
a lullaby makes head to head

half-sleepingSave it
my mother would say meaning
just the opposite She didn’t

want to hear my evidence
against her terrible optimism
for me And though despite her

I can redeem in a pawnshop
sense almost any bad moment
from my childhood I see now

what she must have intended
for me I felt it for her
watching her as she slept

watching her suck as she
dreamed of sucking lightheaded
with thirst as my blood flowed

suddenly into tissue that
changed it to milk No matter
that we were alone there’s a

texture that moves between me
and whatever might have injured
us then Like the curtain’s sheer

opacity it remains drawn
over what view we have of dawn
here in this onetime desert

now green and replenished
its perfect climate
unthreatened in memory—

though outside as usual
the wind blew the bough bent
under the eaves the hummingbird

touched once the bloodcolored hourglass
the feeder then was gone"
Albert GarciaAugust Morning"It’s ripe the melon
by our sink Yellow
bee-bitten soft it perfumes
the house too sweetly
At five I wake the air
mournful in its quiet
My wife’s eyes swim calmly
under their lids her mouth and jaw
relaxed different
What is happening in the silence
of this house Curtains
hang heavily from their rods
Ficus leaves tremble
at my footsteps Yet
the colors outside are perfect--
orange geranium blue lobelia
I wander from room to room
like a man in a museum
wife children books flowers
melon Such still air Soon
the mid-morning breeze will float in
like tepid water then hot
How do I start this day
I who am unsure
of how my life has happened
or how to proceed
amid this warm and steady sweetness"
Susanna BlamireAuld Robin Forbes"And auld Robin Forbes hes gien tem a dance
I pat on my speckets to see them aw prance
I thout o’ the days when I was but fifteen
And skipp’d wi’ the best upon Forbes’s green
Of aw things that is I think thout is meast queer
It brings that that’s by-past and sets it down here
I see Willy as plain as I dui this bit leace
When he tuik his cwoat lappet and deeghted his feace

The lasses aw wonder’d what Willy cud see
In yen that was dark and hard featur’d leyke me
And they wonder’d ay mair when they talk’d o’ my wit
And slily telt Willy that cudn’t be it
But Willy he laugh’d and he meade me his weyfe
And whea was mair happy thro’ aw his lang leyfe
It’s e’en my great comfort now Willy is geane
The he offen said— nae place was leyke his awn heame

I mind when I carried my wark to yon steyle
Where Willy was deykin the time to beguile
He wad fling me a daisy to put i’ my breast
And I hammer’d my noddle to mek out a jest
But merry or grave Willy often wad tell
There was nin o’ the leave that was leyke my awn sel
And he spak what he thout for I’d hardly a plack
When we married and nobbet ae gown to my back

When the clock had struck eight I expected him heame
And wheyles went to meet him as far as Dumleane
Of aw hours it telt
eight
was dearest to me
But now when it streykes there’s a tear i’ my ee
O Willy dear Willy it never can be
That age time or death can divide thee and me
For that spot on earth that’s aye dearest to me
Is the turf that has cover’d my Willy frae me"
Marilyn L TaylorAunt Eudoras Harlequin Romance"She turns the bedlamp on The book falls open
in her mottled hands and while she reads
her mouth begins to quiver forming words
like Breathless Promises Elope
As she turns the leaves Eudoras cheek
takes on a bit of bloom Her frowzy hair
thickens and turns gold her dim eyes clear
the wattles vanish from her slender neck
Her waist emerging from its ring of flesh
bends to the side Breasts that used to hang
like pockets rise and ripen her long legs
tremble Her eyes close she holds her breath—
the steamy pages flutter by unread
as lover after lover finds her bed"
Ed RobersonAunt Haint"She would post herself in the way
in lines headed to transfer stops to change
or haunt intersections with four way full
scarecrow indecision stop

on the corners of streets and in the aisles
of buses preaching only that
which has never left these crossings for road
for choice   — the angry fear    She seats

at the feasts  — Thanksgiving any
holiday any family place
setting   — the hunger of others’
satisfaction for herself she seeks it

said this is what she deserves if only
of herself What she thinks she thinks
needs to be said whatever anyone
else thinks to be honest So there

she sings from that part of the door
she’s never got through the eye
which requires it all taken  off  down
all blown away  to get through to

that still naked-ness of clear again
even if she’s not    still the voice comes through
that if we could listen as she is equally
raw  hear with meat and gut below the skin

beyond the last violence
to the silence just before
the bone   if we could still hear there
we’d hear






What hand can you offer one wanting
just to get even for what it doesn’t know what

just to take out what it feels on someone else
to hurt because it can’t get at where it hurts   itself

to have to see to clear like a movie fakes
done seeing sharper than thought can cut to it

what hand can you offer one that doesn’t know even
as a balance any other than more as my half and

who counts itself that much   more
and that more proofless   multiple unanswerably human hurts

because it can’t figure out a figure to answer how it wants
so count doesn’t count higher than want

and want also falls short enough to take someone down
for it

but there is no size for another to be cut down to but none
but death  this is so frustrating





You see me get the hell away from her
don’t you   quick as I can  and I bein nice
she act all girlfriend but that bitch dangerous

she pull so much rotten shit on peoples
she due to get her ass killed anytime
and I don’t tend to be nowhere near round

I ain’t getting cut down just for standin
next to her   I ain’t all that innocent
but I don’t be lookin for nothing I don’t deserve"
T S EliotAunt Helen"Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt
And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
Cared for by servants to the number of four
Now when she died there was silence in heaven
And silence at her end of the street
The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet —
He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before
The dogs were handsomely provided for
But shortly afterwards the parrot died too
The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece
And the footman sat upon the dining-table
Holding the second housemaid on his knees —
Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived"

Joyce SutphenThe Aunts"I like it when they get together
and talk in voices that sound
like apple trees and grape vines

and some of them wear hats
and go to Arizona in the winter
and they all like to play cards

They will always be the ones
who say “It is time to go now”
even as we linger at the door

or stand by the waiting cars they
remember someone—an uncle we
never knew—and sigh all

of them together like wind
in the oak trees behind the farm
where they grew up—a place

I remember—especially
the hen house and the soft
clucking that filled the sunlit yard"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""for E

I stop my hand midair

If I touch her there everything about me will be true
The New World discovered without pick or ax

I will be what Brenda Jones was stoned for in 
I saw it as a girl but didn’t know I was taking in myself

My hand remembers treading the watery room
just behind the rose-veiled eyes of memory

Alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car
lucky clover all about her feet green tea-sweet necklace
for her mud-pie crusty work boots

She fends off their spit amp words with silent two-handed
twists amp turns of her socket wrench A hurl of sticks amp
stones and only me to whisper for her from sidewalk far

break my bones A grown woman in grease-pocket overalls
inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of
hurled red hots Beneath the hood of her candy-apple Camaro

souped shiny low to the ground

The stars over the Atlantic are dangling
salt crystals The room at the Seashell Inn is
$ a night special winter off-season rate
No one else here but us and the night clerk
five floors below alone with his cherished
stack of Spiderman My lips are red snails
in a primal search for every constellation
hiding in the sky of your body My hand
waits for permission for my life to agree
to be changed forever Can Captain Night
Clerk hear my fingers tambourining you
there on the moon Won’t he soon climb
the stairs and bam on the hood of this car
You are a woman with film reels for eyes
Years of long talking have brought us to the
land of the body Our skin is one endless
prayer bead of brown If my hand ever lands
I will fly past dreaming Australian Aborigines
The old claw hammer and monkey wrench
that flew at Brenda Jones will fly across the
yard of ocean at me A grease rag will be
thrust into my painter’s pants against my
will I will never be able to wash or peel
any of this away Before the night is over
someone I do not know will want the keys
to my ’ silver Thunderbird He will chase
me down the street A gaggle of spooked
hens will fly up in my grandmother’s yard
never to lay another egg just as I am jump-

of sweet clover"
Dan Beachy-QuickAuricle"I listen and listen but how do I know
Peace Peace in the plural says please or pleads
I hear the whole song divide the state as one
appeals past the last centuries’ pealing bells
wren under eaves ruins another wren’s heaven
dying sympathies appear as a pear or peas
with her territory her tune I want a nest
clinging to the twine Please Please in the plural
not a flag a mead hall not a circumstance
puts pain’s poor plea deeper in the apparent
a stable not a stability where animals dream
pressure the daylily plant the possible prayer
and dreaming among them I tell the stranger
pulling apart the sepal petals by their dusty crease
in my mind I can’t I don’t know how to sing"

My heart beat in my brain Life’s violent flood
Abolished bounds–and which my neighbour’s field
Which mine what mattered It is so in youth
We play at leap-frog over the god Term
The love within us and the love without
Are mixed confounded if we are loved or love
We scarce distinguish So with other power
Being acted on and acting seem the same
In that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels
We know not if the forests move or we
And so like most young poets in a flush
Of individual life I poured myself
Along the veins of others and achieved
Mere lifeless imitations of life verse
And made the living answer for the dead
Profaning nature ‘Touch not do not taste
Nor handle’–we’re too legal who write young
We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs
As if still ignorant of counterpoint
We call the Muse  ‘O Muse benignant Muse’–
As if we had seen her purple-braided head
With the eyes in it start between the boughs
As often as a stag’s What make-believe
With so much earnest what effete results
From virile efforts what cold wire-drawn odes
From such white heats–bucolics where the cows
Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
In lashing off the flies–didactics driven
Against the heels of what the master said
And counterfeiting epics shrill with trumps
A babe might blow between two straining cheeks
Of bubbled rose to make his mother laugh
And elegiac griefs and songs of love
Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road
The worse for being warm all these things writ
On happy mornings with a morning heart
That leaps for love is active for resolve
Weak for art only Oft the ancient forms
Will thrill indeed in carrying the young blood
The wine-skins now and then a little warped
Will crack even as the new wine gurgles in
Spare the old bottles–spill not the new wine
By Keats’s soul the man who never stepped
In gradual progress like another man
But turning grandly on his central self
Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years
And died not young–the life of a long life
Distilled to a mere drop falling like a tear
Upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn
For ever by that strong excepted soul
I count it strange and hard to understand
That nearly all young poets should write old
That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen
And beardless Byron academical
And so with others It may be perhaps
Such have not settled long and deep enough
In trance to attain to clairvoyance–and still
The memory mixes with the vision spoils
And works it turbid
Or perhaps again
In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx
The melancholy desert must sweep round
Behind you as before–
For me I wrote
False poems like the rest and thought them true
Because myself was true in writing them
I peradventure have writ true ones since
With less complacence
But I could not hide
My quickening inner life from those at watch
They saw a light at a window now and then
They had not set there Who had set it there
My father’s sister started when she caught
My soul agaze in my eyes She could not say
I had no business with a sort of soul
But plainly she objected–and demurred
That souls were dangerous things to carry straight
Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world
She said sometimes ‘Aurora have you done
Your task this morning–have you read that book
And are you ready for the crochet here’–
As if she said ‘I know there’s something wrong
I know I have not ground you down enough
To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
For household uses and proprieties
Before the rain has got into my barn
And set the grains a-sprouting What you’re green
With out-door impudence you almost grow’
To which I answered ‘Would she hear my task
And verify my abstract of the book
And should I sit down to the crochet work
Was such her pleasure’  Then I sate and teased
The patient needle til it split the thread
Which oozed off from it in meandering lace
From hour to hour I was not therefore sad
My soul was singing at a work apart
Behind the wall of sense as safe from harm
As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight
In vortices of glory and blue air
And so through forced work and spontaneous work
The inner life informed the outer life
Reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms
Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams
And rounding to the spheric soul the thin
Pined body struck a colour up the cheeks
Though somewhat faint I clenched my brows across
My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass
And said ‘We’ll live Aurora we’ll be strong
The dogs are on us–but we will not die’"

   Second Book""There it is–
You play beside a death-bed like a child
Yet measure to yourself a prophets place
To teach the living None of all these things
Can women understand You generalise
Oh nothing–not even grief Your quick-breathed hearts
So sympathetic to the personal pang
Close on each separate knife-stroke yielding up
A whole life at each wound incapable
Of deepening widening a large lap of life
To hold the world-full woe The human race
To you means such a child or such a man
You saw one morning waiting in the cold
Beside that gate perhaps You gather up
A few such cases and when strong sometimes
Will write of factories and of slaves as if
Your father were a negro and your son
A spinner in the mills Alls yours and you–
All coloured with your blood or otherwise
Just nothing to you Why I call you hard
To general suffering Heres the world half blind
With intellectual light half brutalised
With civilization having caught the plague
In silks from Tarsus shrieking east and west
Along a thousand railroads mad with pain
And sin too  does one woman of you all
You who weep easily grow pale to see
This tiger shake his cage–does one of you
Stand still from dancing stop from stringing pearls
And pine and die because of the great sum
Of universal anguish–Show me a tear
Wet as Cordelias in eyes bright as yours
Because the world is mad You cannot count
That you should weep for this account not you
You weep for what you know A red-haired child
Sick in a fever if you touch him once
Though but so little as with a finger-tip
Will set you weeping but a million sick  
You could as soon weep for the rule of three
Or compound fractions Therefore this same world
Uncomprehended by you must remain
Uninfluenced by you Women as you are
Mere women personal and passionate
You give us doating mothers and chaste wives
Sublime Madonnas and enduring saints
We get no Christ from you–and verily
We shall not get a poet in my mind
With which conclusion you conclude  
But this–
That you Aurora with the large live brow
And steady eyelids cannot condescend
To play at art as children play at swords
To show a pretty spirit chiefly admired
Because true action is impossible
You never can be satisfied with praise
Which men give women when they judge a book
Not as mere work but as mere womans work
Expressing the comparative respect
Which means the absolute scorn Oh excellent
What grace what facile turns what fluent sweeps
What delicate discernment  almost thought
The book does honour to the sex we hold
Among our female authors we make room
For this fair writer and congratulate
The country that produces in these times
Such women competent to  spell
Stop there
I answered–burning through his thread of talk
With a quick flame of emotion–You have read
My soul if not my book and argue well
I would not condescend  we will not say
To such a kind of praise a worthless end
Is praise of all kinds but to such a use
Of holy art and golden life I am young
And peradventure weak–you tell me so–
Through being a woman And for all the rest
Take thanks for justice I would rather dance
At fairs on tight-rope till the babies dropped
Their gingerbread for joy–than shift the types
For tolerable verse intolerable
To men who act and suffer Better far
Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means
Than a sublime art frivolously

Then I spoke
I have not stood long on the strand of life
And these salt waters have had scarcely time
To creep so high up as to wet my feet
I cannot judge these tides–I shall perhaps
A womans always younger than a man
At equal years because she is disallowed
Maturing by the outdoor sun and air
And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk
Ah well I know you men judge otherwise
You think a woman ripens as a peach–
In the cheeks chiefly Pass it to me now
Im young in age and younger still I think
As a woman But a child may say amen
To a bishops prayer and see the way it goes
And I incapable to loose the knot
Of social questions can approve applaud
August compassion christian thoughts that shoot
Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims
Accept my reverence
There he glowed on me
With all his face and eyes No other help
Said he–no more than so
What help I asked
Youd scorn my help–as Natures self you say
Has scorned to put her music in my mouth
Because a womans Do you now turn round
And ask for what a woman cannot give
For what she only can I turn and ask
He answered catching up my hands in his
And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
The full weight of his soul–I ask for love
And that she can for life in fellowship
Through bitter duties–that I know she can
For wifehood  will she
Now I said may God
Be witness twixt us two and with the word
Meseemed I floated into a sudden light
Above his stature–am I proved too weak
To stand alone yet strong enough to bear
Such leaners on my shoulder poor to think
Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought
Incompetent to sing as blackbirds can
Yet competent to love like HIM
I paused
Perhaps I darkened as the lighthouse will
That turns upon the sea Its always so
Anything does for a wife
Aurora dear
And dearly honoured  he pressed in at once
With eager utterance–you translate me ill
I do not contradict my thought of you
Which is most reverent with another thought
Found less so If your sex is weak for art
And I who said so did but honour you
By using truth in courtship it is strong
For life and duty Place your fecund heart
In mine and let us blossom for the world
That wants loves colour in the grey of time
With all my talk I can but set you where
You look down coldly on the arena-heaps
Of headless bodies shapeless indistinct
The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way
Through such a heap of generalised distress
To the individual man with lips and eyes–
Much less Aurora Ah my sweet come down
And hand in hand well go where yours shall touch
These victims one by one till one by one
The formless nameless trunk of every man
Shall seem to wear a head with hair you know
And every woman catch your mothers face
To melt you into passion
I am a girl
I answered slowly you do well to name
My mothers face Though far too early alas
Gods hand did interpose twixt it and me
I know so much of love as used to shine
In that face and another Just so much
No more indeed at all I have not seen
So much love since I pray you pardon me
As answers even to make a marriage with
In this cold land of England What you love
Is not a woman Romney but a cause
You want a helpmate not a mistress sir–
A wife to help your ends  in her no end
Your cause is noble your ends excellent
But I being most unworthy of these and that
Do otherwise conceive of love Farewell
Farewell Aurora you reject me thus
He said
Why sir you are married long ago
You have a wife already whom you love
Your social theory Bless you both I say
For my part I am scarcely meek enough
To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse
Do I look a Hagar think you
So you jest
Nay so I speak in earnest I replied
You treat of marriage too much like at least
A chief apostle you would bear with you
A wife  a sister  shall we speak it out
A sister of charity
Then must it be
Indeed farewell And was I so far wrong
In hope and in illusion when I took
The woman to be nobler than the man
Yourself the noblest woman–in the use
And comprehension of what love is–love
That generates the likeness of itself
Through all heroic duties so far wrong
In saying bluntly venturing truth on love
Come human creature love and work with me–
Instead of Lady thou art wondrous fair
And where the Graces walk before the Muse
Will follow at the lighting of the eyes
And where the Muse walks lovers need to creep
Turn round and love me or I die of love
With quiet indignation I broke in
You misconceive the question like a man
Who sees a woman as the complement
Of his sex merely You forget too much
That every creature female as the male
Stands single in responsible act and thought
As also in birth and death Whoever says
To a loyal woman Love and work with me
Will get fair answers if the work and love
Being good themselves are good for her–the best
She was born for Women of a softer mood
Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life
Will sometimes only hear the first word love
And catch up with it any kind of work
Indifferent so that dear love go with it
I do not blame such women though for love
They pick much oakum earths fanatics make
Too frequently heavens saints But me your work
Is not the best for–nor your love the best
Nor able to commend the kind of work
For loves sake merely Ah you force me sir
To be over-bold in speaking of myself–
I too have my vocation–work to do
The heavens and earth have set me since I changed
My fathers face for theirs–and though your world
Were twice as wretched as you represent
Most serious work most necessary work
As any of the economists Reform
Make trade a Christian possibility
And individual right no general wrong
Wipe out earths furrows of the Thine and Mine
And leave one green for men to play at bowls
With innings for them all  what then indeed
If mortals were not greater by the head
Than any of their prosperities what then
Unless the artist keep up open roads
Betwixt the seen and unseen–bursting through
The best of your conventions with his best
The unspeakable imaginable best
God bids him speak to prove what lies beyond
Both speech and imagination A starved man
Exceeds a fat beast well not barter sir
The beautiful for barley–And even so
I hold you will not compass your poor ends
Of barley-feeding and material ease
Without a poets individualism
To work your universal It takes a soul
To move a body it takes a high-souled man
To move the masses  even to a cleaner stye
It takes the ideal to blow a hairs breadth off
The dust of the actual–ah your Fouriers failed
Because not poets enough to understand
That life develops from within–For me
Perhaps I am not worthy as you say
Of work like this  perhaps a womans soul
Aspires and not creates yet we aspire
And yet Ill try out your perhapses sir
And if I fail  why burn me up my straw
Like other false works–Ill not ask for grace
Your scorn is better cousin Romney I
Who love my art would never wish it lower
To suit my stature I may love my art
Youll grant that even a woman may love art
Seeing that to waste true love on anything
Is womanly past question"

   Third Book""Why what a pettish petty thing I grow–
A mere mere woman–a mere flaccid nerve-
A kerchief left out all night in the rain
Turned soft so–overtasked and overstrained
And overlived in this close London life
And yet I should be stronger
Never burn
Your letters poor Aurora for they stare
With red seals from the table saying each
Heres something that you know not"
Joanna KlinkAuroras"It began in a foyer of evenings
The evenings left traces of glass in the trees
A book and a footpath we followed
Under throat-pipes of birds

We moved through a room of leaves
Thin streams of silver buried under our eyes
A field of white clover buried under our eyes
Or a river we stopped at to watch
The wind cross it recross it

Room into room you paused
Where once on a stoop we leaned back
Talking late into daylight
The morning trees shook off twilight
Opening and closing our eyes auroras

Beyond groves and flora we followed a road
Dotted with polished brown bottles
Scoured furrows a wood emptied of trees

It was enough to hollow us out
The evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet
Branches with spaces for winds

The earth changes
The way we speak to each other has changed
As for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits
Listening for a landscape beyond us"
Cyrus Cassells"Auschwitz All Hallows""Look we have made
a counterpoint

of white chrysanthemums
a dauntless path

of death-will-not-part-us petals
and revering light

even here
even here

before the once-wolfish ovens
the desecrating wall

where you were shot
the shrike-stern cells

where you were bruised
and emptied of your time-bound beauty—

you of the confiscated shoes
and swift-shorn hair

you who left
as sobering testament the scuffed

luggage of utter hope
and harrowing deception

Come back teach us
From these fearsome barracks

and inglorious fields
flecked with human ash

in the russet-billowing hours
of All Hallows

let the pianissimo
of your truest whispering

vivid as the crunched frost
of a forced march

become a slowly blossoming
ever-voluble hearth

revealing to us
the baffled the irresolute

the war torn the living
more of the fire

and attar of what it means
to be human"
Stephen EdgarAuspices"In siftings of chromatic sediment
Shed by the winter hours as they decay
With slow descent
Light settles through the lower sky in peach
Then mauve then pale self-abnegating gray
Against the water now that day is spent
At Bennetts Beach

Under the high withdrawing blueness band
On band like layers in a decorative
Bottle of sand
Enclosed beneath the heavens’ dome as though
This were the perfect realm in which to live
Preserved unburdened by the least demand
Or wish to know—

And simply be Along the beach convene
Some silver gulls which stand around reﬂecting
Upon the sheen
That comes and goes about their scarlet feet
And crested terns ﬂy back and forth inspecting
The shallows for a last titbit to glean
And lightly treat

A two-faced wind that works its way across
The metal of the sea it tries to planish
And to emboss
While deep in its unbalanced buffetings
Gannets alternately appear and vanish
Plunge rise and loft and give their heads a toss
These things these things"
Robert AdamsonAustralasian Darters"These water birds flew out from the minds
Of fishermen and became fishing peons
Wealthy sailors watched as darters emerged again
To spread drenched wings in the sun
And marked them as emblems for spinnakers

Painters and ornithologists studied darters
Until they became black-feathered arrows
That pierced the souls of their creators
These birds rode surf of bitter laughter
And wiped out on a zoo’s concrete Key Largo

To imitate darters lovers ripped off their clothes
And plunged into the swiftness of estuaries
Down the water column they entered brackish hell
Their hair transformed to iridescent plumage
Ruffled by memories of earth’s human atmosphere

We can experience the lives of these feathered beings
By flexing our particular despairs each morning
At evening we take in the news as best we can
On late nights we gaze at dead bodies of water
And almost perceive those wet wings working the tide"
Alfred CornThe Author of Torah"The blessing safely lifted onto Joshua’s shoulders
Moses climbed up Mount Nebo high above Moab
Tendons winced as he bent to retie a sandal and haze
flooded his vision which had nothing to see
or black rock and scrub thorn only until he stopped
and said I will wait here for the voice of the Most High

You showed him all the land—
Gilead the hills of Ephraim and Manasseh
from Judah to the western sea as far as Zoar
And said Your eyes have seen what I promised
yet because at Meribah-Kadesh
you failed to manifest the holiness I am
you do not go in

At that distance and from the heights
Moses stood and watched as the children
of Israel began the westward trek
His sight strengthened and he saw each one
The mother thin and staring bent down
to take her firstborn’s hand
who cried and then laughed
The young brothers with new beards
and faces blackened by years in Sinai strode along
carrying all they had rolled up in a sheepskin
The white-haired elder and his mourning wife
whose only daughter was lost in the desert
stalked slowly forward without speaking
An orphaned girl her cousin and her cousin’s husband
discussed it quietly and held hands
A concert of voices murmurs cries laughter
rising falling babbling like water
the fountain of Meribah-Kadesh that sprang
from a wall of rock in the desert
when Moses struck it with his staff

Days of his life returned to him
One last time he saw Miriam’s serious gaze
during the hours of instruction He recalled
the harp players in Pharaoh’s summer palace
white noonday and the shadow of his hand
raised to strike the Egyptian overseer
Zipporah’s fear and trust when Jethro urged her forward
the brush-tree that spoke out in tongues of fire
Egypt’s plagues blood on the doorposts for a sign
the exiles’ safe conduct across marshlands
among bulrushes as seabirds called overhead
mutiny and lightning in the desert
a pillar of smoke by day and fire by night

The moment drew near as those he was
bound to and had contended with went up
to a land of hills dusted with the first spring green
Sheep stopped their grazing to stare like an intake
of breath a lull suspended the low hum
hovering around hillsides in flower
His eyes filled with tears And silver bands of sun
broke from a veil of cloud overhead
down to the plain of Moab lighting the face
of Joshua on one side so that half
remained in shadow

At that moment Moses was taken to his people
His body is said to be buried at Beth-Peor yet
the grave has never been found

The grave has never been found—
and Joshua led the Israelites westward into Canaan"
Ishmael ReedThe Author Reflects on His th Birthday" I have been looking forward
To you for many years now
So much so that
I feel you and I are old
Friends and so on this day 
I propose a toast to
Me and You
 From this day on
I swear before the bountiful
Osiris that
If I ever
If I EVER
Try to bring out the
Best in folks again I
Want somebody to take me
Outside and kick me up and
Down the sidewalk or
Sit me in a corner with a
Funnel on my head

Make me as hard as a rock
 like the fellow in
The story about the
Big one that got away
Let me laugh my head off
With Moby Dick as we reminisce
About them suckers who went
Down with the Pequod
 I ain’t been mean enough
Make me real real mean
Mean as old Marie rolling her eyes
Mean as the town Bessie sings about
“Where all the birds sing bass”

 Make me Tennessee mean
Cobra mean
Cuckoo mean
Injun mean
Dracula mean
Beethovenian-brows mean
Miles Davis mean
Don’t-offer-assistance-when
Quicksand-is-tugging-some-poor
Dope-under-mean
Pawnbroker mean
Pharaoh mean
That’s it 
Make me Pharaoh mean
Mean as can be
Mean as the dickens
Meaner than mean

When I walk down the street
I want them to whisper
There goes Mr Mean
“He’s double mean
He even turned the skeletons
In his closet out into
The cold”

And 
Don’t let me trust anybody
Over Reed but
Just in case
Put a tail on that
Negro too

Ilya KaminskyAuthor’s Prayer"If I speak for the dead I must leave
this animal of my body

I must write the same poem over and over
for an empty page is the white flag of their surrender

If I speak for them I must walk on the edge
of myself I must live as a blind man

who runs through rooms without
touching the furniture

Yes I live I can cross the streets asking “What year is it”
I can dance in my sleep and laugh

in front of the mirror
Even sleep is a prayer Lord

I will praise your madness and
in a language not mine speak

of music that wakes us music
in which we move For whatever I say

is a kind of petition and the darkest
days must I praise"
Anne BradstreetThe Author to Her Book"Thou ill-form’d offspring of my feeble brain
Who after birth didst by my side remain
Till snatched from thence by friends less wise than true
Who thee abroad expos’d to publick view
Made thee in raggs halting to th’ press to trudge
Where errors were not lessened all may judg
At thy return my blushing was not small
My rambling brat in print should mother call
I cast thee by as one unfit for light
Thy Visage was so irksome in my sight
Yet being mine own at length affection would
Thy blemishes amend if so I could
I wash’d thy face but more defects I saw
And rubbing off a spot still made a flaw
I stretched thy joynts to make thee even feet
Yet still thou run’st more hobling then is meet
In better dress to trim thee was my mind
But nought save home-spun Cloth i’ th’ house I find
In this array ’mongst Vulgars mayst thou roam
In Criticks hands beware thou dost not come
And take thy way where yet thou art not known
If for thy Father askt say thou hadst none
And for thy Mother she alas is poor
Which caus’d her thus to send thee out of door"

Dear old equivocal and closest friend
Grand Vizier to a weak bewildered king
Now we approach The Ecclesiastean Age
Where the heart is like to go off inside your chest
Like a party favor or the brain blow a fuse
And the comic-book light-bulb of Idea black out
Forever the idiot balloon of speech
Go blank and we shall know if it be knowing
The world as it was before language once again

Mighty Fortress maybe already mined
And readying to blow up grievances
About the lifetime of your servitude
The body of this death one talkative saint
Wanted to be delivered of not yet
Aggressively asserting your ancient right
To our humiliation by the bowel
Or the rough justice of the elderly lecher’s
Retiring from this incontinence to that

Regardless the parody and satire and
The nevertheless forgiveness of the soul
Or mind self spirit will or whatever else

   Launch Audio in a New Window"" did your child lose acquired speech


A fount and then silence A none An ellipse
between — his breath through
the seams of our windows Whistle
of days Impossible bowl of a mouth —
the open cupboard vowels
rounded up and swept under the rug

 does your child produce unusual noises or infantile squeals


He’d coo and we’d coo back The sound
passed back and forth between us like a ball
Or later an astral voice Some vibrato
under the surface of us The burst upon —
burn of strings rubbed
in a flourish His exhausted face

 is your child’s voice louder than required


In an enclosure or a cave it is difficult to gauge
one’s volume The proscenium of the world
All the rooms we speak of are dark places Because
he cannot see his mouth he cannot imagine
the sound that comes out

 does your child speak frequent gibberish or jargon


To my ears it is a language Every sound
a system the sound for dog or boy The moan
in his throat for water — that of a man with thirst
The dilapidated ladder that makes a sentence
a sentence This plosive is a verb This liquid
a want We make symbols of his noise

 does your child have difficulty understanding basic things “just can’t get it”


Against the backdrop of the tree he looks so small

 does your child pull you around when he wants something


By the sleeve By the shirttail His light touch
hopscotching against my skin like sparrows
An insistence muscled and muscled again

 does your child have difficulty expressing his needs or desires using gestures


Red-faced in the kitchen and in the bedroom
and the yellow light touches his eyes
which are open but not there His eyes
rest in their narrow boat dream and the canals
are wide dividing this side from this side

 is there no spontaneous initiation of speech or communication from your child


When called he eases out of his body
His god is not our words nor is it
the words from his lips It is entirely body
So when he comes to us and looks we know
there are beyond us impossible cylinders
where meaning lives

 does your child repeat heard words parts of words or tv commercials


The mind circles the mind in the arena far in — far in
where the consonants touch and where the round
chorus flaunts its iambs in a metronomic trot Humming
to himself in warm and jugular songs

 does your child use repetitive language same word or phrase over and over


A pocket in his brain worries its ball of lint
A word clicks into its groove and stammers
along its track Dopplering like a car with its windows
rolled down and the one top hit of the summer
angles its way into his brain

 does your child have difficulty sustaining a conversation


We could be anywhere then the navel of the red moon
drops its fruit His world This stained world drips its honey
into our mouths Our words stolen from his malingering afternoon

 does your child use monotonous speech or wrong pausing


When the air is true and simple we can watch him tremble
for an hour plucking his meaning from a handful of utterances
and then ascend into the terrible partition of speech

 does your child speak the same to kids adults or objects can’t differentiate


Because a reference needs a frame we are mother and father
and child with a world of time to be understood The car radio
plays its one song The song therefore is important
It must be intoned at a rigorous time Because rigor
is important and because the self insists on constant vigils

 does your child use language inappropriately wrong words or phrases


Always and he insists on the incorrect forms
The wrong word takes every form for love —
the good tree leans into the pond
the gray dog’s ribs show the memory
bound to the window and the promise of the radio
playing its song on the hour Every wrong form
is a form which represents us in our losses
if it takes us another world to understand"

underneath the basket I was certain I had nothing to say
When I grew restless in the interior
the exterior gave"
Michael PalmerAutobiography"All clocks are clouds

Parts are greater than the whole

A philosopher is starving in a rooming house while it rains outside

He regards the self as just another sign

Winter roses are invisible

Late ice sometimes sings


A and Not-A are the same

My dog does not know me

Violins like dreams are suspect

I come from Kolophon or perhaps some small island

The strait has frozen and people are walking—a few skating—across it

On the crescent beach a drowned deer


A woman with one hand her thighs around your neck

The world is all that is displaced

Apples in a stall at the streetcorner by the Bahnhof pale yellow to blackish red

Memory does not speak

Shortness of breath accompanied by tinnitus

The poet’s stutter and the philosopher’s


The self is assigned to others

A room for which at all times the moon remains visible

Leningrad cafe a man missing the left side of his face

Disappearance of the sun from the sky above Odessa

True description of that sun

A philosopher lies in a doorway discussing the theory of colors


with himself

the theory of self with himself the concept of number eternal return the sidereal pulse

logic of types Buridan sentences the lekton

Why now that smoke off the lake

Word and things are the same

Many times white ravens have I seen


That all planes are infinite by extension

She asks Is there a map of these gates

She asks Is this one called Passages or is that one to the west

Thus released the dark angels converse with the angels of light

They are not angels

Something else


for Poul Borum"
Lawrence FerlinghettiAutobiography"I am leading a quiet life
in Mike’s Place every day
watching the champs
of the Dante Billiard Parlor
and the French pinball addicts
I am leading a quiet life
on lower East Broadway
I am an American
I was an American boy
I read the American Boy Magazine
and became a boy scout
in the suburbs
I thought I was Tom Sawyer
catching crayfish in the Bronx River
and imagining the Mississippi
I had a baseball mit
and an American Flyer bike
I delivered the Woman’s Home Companion
at five in the afternoon
or the Herald Trib
at five in the morning
I still can hear the paper thump
on lost porches
I had an unhappy childhood
I saw Lindbergh land
I looked homeward
and saw no angel
I got caught stealing pencils
from the Five and Ten Cent Store
the same month I made Eagle Scout
I chopped trees for the CCC
and sat on them
I landed in Normandy
in a rowboat that turned over
I have seen the educated armies
on the beach at Dover
I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple clouds
shopkeepers rolling up their blinds
at midday
potato salad and dandelions
at anarchist picnics
I am reading ‘Lorna Doone’
and a life of John Most
terror of the industrialist
a bomb on his desk at all times
I have seen the garbagemen parade
in the Columbus Day Parade
behind the glib
farting trumpeters
I have not been out to the Cloisters
in a long time
nor to the Tuileries
but I still keep thinking
of going
I have seen the garbagemen parade
when it was snowing
I have eaten hotdogs in ballparks
I have heard the Gettysburg Address
and the Ginsberg Address
I like it here
and I won’t go back
where I came from
I too have ridden boxcars boxcars boxcars
I have travelled among unknown men
I have been in Asia
with Noah in the Ark
I was in India
when Rome was built
I have been in the Manger
with an Ass
I have seen the Eternal Distributor
from a White Hill
in South San Francisco
and the Laughing Woman at Loona Park
outside the Fun House
in a great rainstorm
still laughing
I have heard the sound of revelry
by night
I have wandered lonely
as a crowd
I am leading a quiet life
outside of Mike’s Place every day
watching the world walk by
in its curious shoes
I once started out
to walk around the world
but ended up in Brooklyn
That Bridge was too much for me
I have engaged in silence
exile and cunning
I flew too near the sun
and my wax wings fell off
I am looking for my Old Man
whom I never knew
I am looking for the Lost Leader
with whom I flew
Young men should be explorers
Home is where one starts from
But Mother never told me
there’d be scenes like this
Womb-weary
I rest
I have travelled
I have seen goof city
I have seen the mass mess
I have heard Kid Ory cry
I have heard a trombone preach
I have heard Debussy
strained thru a sheet
I have slept in a hundred islands
where books were trees
I have heard the birds
that sound like bells
I have worn grey flannel trousers
and walked upon the beach of hell
I have dwelt in a hundred cities
where trees were books
What subways what taxis what cafes
What women with blind breasts
limbs lost among skyscrapers
I have seen the statues of heroes
at carrefours
Danton weeping at a metro entrance
Columbus in Barcelona
pointing Westward up the Ramblas
toward the American Express
Lincoln in his stony chair
And a great Stone Face
in North Dakota
I know that Columbus
did not invent America
I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra Pounds
They should all be freed
It is long since I was a herdsman
I am leading a quiet life
in Mike’s Place every day
reading the Classified columns
I have read the Reader’s Digest
from cover to cover
and noted the close identification
of the United States and the Promised Land
where every coin is marked
In God We Trust
but the dollar bills do not have it
being gods unto themselves
I read the Want Ads daily
looking for a stone a leaf
an unfound door
I hear America singing
in the Yellow Pages
One could never tell
the soul has its rages
I read the papers every day
and hear humanity amiss
in the sad plethora of print
I see where Walden Pond has been drained
to make an amusement park
I see they’re making Melville
eat his whale
I see another war is coming
but I won’t be there to fight it
I have read the writing
on the outhouse wall
I helped Kilroy write it
I marched up Fifth Avenue
blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon
but hurried back to the Casbah
looking for my dog
I see a similarity
between dogs and me
Dogs are the true observers
walking up and down the world
thru the Molloy country
I have walked down alleys
too narrow for Chryslers
I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons
in a vacant lot in Astoria
Ben Shahn never painted them
but they’re there
askew in Astoria
I have heard the junkman’s obbligato
I have ridden superhighways
and believed the billboard’s promises
Crossed the Jersey Flats
and seen the Cities of the Plain
And wallowed in the wilds of Westchester
with its roving bands of natives
in stationwagons
I have seen them
I am the man
I was there
I suffered
somewhat
I am an American
I have a passport
I did not suffer in public
And I’m too young to die
I am a selfmade man
And I have plans for the future
I am in line
for a top job
I may be moving on
to Detroit
I am only temporarily
a tie salesman
I am a good Joe
I am an open book
to my boss
I am a complete mystery
to my closest friends
I am leading a quiet life
in Mike’s Place every day
contemplating my navel
I am a part
of the body’s long madness
I have wandered in various nightwoods
I have leaned in drunken doorways
I have written wild stories
without punctuation
I am the man
I was there
I suffered
somewhat
I have sat in an uneasy chair
I am a tear of the sun
I am a hill
where poets run
I invented the alphabet
after watching the flight of cranes
who made letters with their legs
I am a lake upon a plain
I am a word
in a tree
I am a hill of poetry
I am a raid
on the inarticulate
I have dreamt
that all my teeth fell out
but my tongue lived
to tell the tale
For I am a still
of poetry
I am a bank of song
I am a playerpiano
in an abandoned casino
on a seaside esplanade
in a dense fog
still playing
I see a similarity
between the Laughing Woman
and myself
I have heard the sound of summer
in the rain
I have seen girls on boardwalks
have complicated sensations
I understand their hesitations
I am a gatherer of fruit
I have seen how kisses
cause euphoria
I have risked enchantment
I have seen the Virgin
in an appletree at Chartres
And Saint Joan burn
at the Bella Union
I have seen giraffes in junglejims
their necks like love
wound around the iron circumstances
of the world
I have seen the Venus Aphrodite
armless in her drafty corridor
I have heard a siren sing
at One Fifth Avenue
I have seen the White Goddess dancing
in the Rue des Beaux Arts
on the Fourteenth of July
and the Beautiful Dame Without Mercy
picking her nose in Chumley’s
She did not speak English
She had yellow hair
and a hoarse voice
I am leading a quiet life
in Mike’s Place every day
watching the pocket pool players
making the minestrone scene
wolfing the macaronis
and I have read somewhere
the Meaning of Existence
yet have forgotten
just exactly where
But I am the man
And I’ll be there
And I may cause the lips
of those who are asleep
to speak
And I may make my notebooks
into sheaves of grass
And I may write my own
eponymous epitaph
instructing the horsemen
to pass"
Kazim AliAutobiography"we didn’t really speak

for A C"
Michael PalmerAutobiography "Yes I was born on the street known as Glass—as Paper Scissors or Rock

Several of my ancestors had no hands

Several of my ancestors used their pens

in odd ways

A child of seven I prayed for breath

Each day I passed through the mirrored X



into droplets of rain congealed around dust

I never regretted this situation

Though patient as an alchemist I failed to learn English

Twenty years later I burned all my furniture

Likewise the beams of my house

to fuel the furnace



Once I bought an old boat

I abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams

and wrote about dresses jewels furniture and menus

eight or ten times in a book of dreams

It sets me to dreaming when I dust it off

Our time is a between time best to stay out of it



Send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living

so they won’t suspect we know they don’t exist

Sign them Sincerely Yours Warmest Regards Thinking of You or
Deepest Regrets

Brown river outside my window an old boat riding the current

What I like most is to stay in my apartment

So that is my life pared of anecdotes



I go out occasionally to look at a dance

Otherwise the usual joys worries and inner mourning

Occasionally in an old boat I navigate the river

when I find the time

Water swallows the days

I think maybe that’s all



I have to say

except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me

It says A candle is consuming a children’s alphabet

It says Attend to each detail of the future-past

Last night the moon was divided precisely in half

Today a terrifying wind"
Yehuda AmichaiAutobiography in the Year "My father built a great worry around me like a dock
Once I left it before I was finished
And he remained with his great empty worry
And my mother—like a tree on the shore
Between her arms outstretched for me

And in  my hands were merry and small
And in  they learned to use a rifle
And when I loved my first love
My thoughts were like a bunch of colored balloons
And the girls white hand clutched them all
With a thin string—and then let them fly

And in  the movement of my life
Was like the movement of many slaves rowing a ship
And the face of my father like the lantern at the end of a parting
train
And my mother closed all the clouds in her brown closet
And I climbed up my street
And the twentieth century was the blood in my veins
Blood that wanted to go out to many wars
Through many openings
It pounds on my head from inside
And moves in angry waves to my heart

But now in the spring of  I see
More birds have returned than left last winter
And I return down the slope of the mountain
To my room where the womans body is heavy
And full of time"
Charles ReznikoffAutobiography New York"I

It is not to be bought for a penny
in the candy store nor picked
from the bushes in the park It may be found perhaps
in the ashes on the distant lots
among the rusting cans and Jimpson weeds
If you wish to eat fish freely
cucumbers and melons
you should have stayed in Egypt

II

I am alone—
and glad to be alone
I do not like people who walk about
so late who walk slowly after midnight
through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks
I do not like
my own face
in the little mirrors of the slot-machines
before the closed stores

III

Walking along the highway
I smell the yellow flowers of a shrub
watch the starlings on a lawn perhaps—
but why are all these
speeding away in automobiles
where are they off to
in such a hurry
They must be going to hear wise men
and to look at beautiful women
and I am just a fool
to be loitering here alone

IV

I like the sound of the street—
but I apart and alone
beside an open window
and behind a closed door

V

Winter is here indeed the leaves have long been swept
from the winding walks trees and ground are brown—
all is in order
Only the lamps now flourish in the park
We walk about and talk
but the troubles of the unsuccessful middle-aged
are so uninteresting

VI

Now it is cold where the snow was melting
the walk crackles with black ice beneath my careful steps
and the snow is old and pitted
here grey with ashes and there yellow with sand
The walks lie in the cold shadow
of houses
pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow
for cold out of the wind but here
where the sunshine pours through a narrow street
upon a little tree black and naked of every leaf
the sparrows are in the sun thick upon the twigs
Those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows
bronze statues now
with outstretched arm or sword
brave only the weather

I find myself talking aloud
as I walk
that is bad
Only Don Juan would believe
I am in conversation with the
snow-covered statues
only St Francis
that I am talking to the sparrows
in the naked bushes
to the pigeons
in the snow

VII

The ropes in the wind
slapping the flag-pole
the flag has been hauled down
behind the bare tree-tops
the lights of an aeroplane
moving away slowly

A star or two shining
between factory chimneys
the street dark and still
because the street-lamp has been broken
and it is cold and late

VIII

Bright upon the table
for your birthday
the burning candles will dissolve
in rays
and lumps of wax
Unlike a skull
they say politely
This is you

IX

I am afraid
because of the foolishness
I have spoken
I must diet
on silence
strengthen myself
with quiet

Where is the wisdom
with which I may be medicined
I will walk by myself
and cure myself
in the sunshine and the wind

X

I do not believe that David killed Goliath
It must have been—
you will find the name in the list of David’s captains
But whoever it was he was no fool
when he took off the helmet
and put down the sword and the spear and the shield
and said The weapons you have given me are good
but they are not mine
I will fight in my own way
with a couple of pebbles and a sling

XI

“Shall I go there” “As you like—
it will not matter you are not at all important”
The words stuck to me
like burrs The path was hidden
under the fallen leaves and here and there
the stream was choked Where it forced a way
the ripples flashed a second
She spoke unkindly but it was the truth
I shared the sunshine like a leaf a ripple

thinking of this sunned myself
and for the moment was content

XII

There is nobody in the street
of those who crowded about David
to watch me
as I dance before the Lord
alone in my unimportance
to do as I like

XIII

Your angry words—each false name
sinks into me and is added to the heap
beneath I am still the same
they are no part of me which I keep
but the way I go and over which I flow

XIV
The Bridge

In a cloud bones of steel

XV
God and Messenger

This pavement barren
as the mountain
on which God spoke to Moses—
suddenly in the street
shining against my legs
the bumper of a motor car

XVI

A beggar stretches out his hand
to touch a fur collar and strokes it unseen
stealing its warmth for his finger tips

XVII

The elevator man working long hours
for little—whose work is dull and trivial—
must also greet each passenger
pleasantly
to be so heroic
he wears a uniform

XVIII

This subway station
with its electric lights pillars of steel arches of cement and trains—
quite an improvement on the caves of the cave-men
but look on this wall
a primitive drawing

XIX
Subway

People moving people standing still crowds
and more crowds a thousand and ten thousand iron girders
as pillars
escape
But how
shut up in the moving train
And upstairs in the street
the sun is shining as it shines in June

XX
Poet with Whiskey Bottle and Sailor

There is anguish there certainly
and a commotion
in the next room
shouts of
words and phrases that do not make sentences
and sentences that do not make sense
I open the door
ah the hallway is crowded—
descendants of the three wise men
now male and female
come again to worship in a stable

XXI

The white cat on the lawn
lying in the sun against the hedge
lovely to look at—
but this stout gentleman
who needs a shave badly
leaning in an arbor hung with purple grapes
purple grapes all about him
is unpleasant
Am I becoming misanthropic
An atheist
Why this might be the god Bacchus

XXII

The bearded rag-picker
seated among heaps of rags in a basement
sings
It was born that way
that is the way it was born—
the way it came out of some body
to stink
nothing will change it—
neither pity nor kindness"
John Greenleaf WhittierAn Autograph"I write my name as one
On sands by waves o’errun
Or winter’s frosted pane
Traces a record vain

Oblivion’s blankness claims
Wiser and better names
And well my own may pass
As from the strand or glass

Wash on O waves of time
Melt noons the frosty rime
Welcome the shadow vast
The silence that shall last

When I and all who know
And love me vanish so
What harm to them or me
Will the lost memory be

If any words of mine
Through right of life divine
Remain what matters it
Whose hand the message writ

Why should the “crowner’s quest”
Sit on my worst or best
Why should the showman claim
The poor ghost of my name

Yet as when dies a sound
Its spectre lingers round
Haply my spent life will
Leave some faint echo still

A whisper giving breath
Of praise or blame to death
Soothing or saddening such
As loved the living much

Therefore with yearnings vain
And fond I still would fain
A kindly judgment seek
A tender thought bespeak

And while my words are read
Let this at least be said
“Whate’er his life’s defeatures
He loved his fellow-creatures

“If of the Law’s stone table
To hold he scarce was able
The first great precept fast
He kept for man the last

“Through mortal lapse and dulness
What lacks the Eternal Fulness
If still our weakness can
Love Him in loving man

“Age brought him no despairing
Of the world’s future faring
In human nature still
He found more good than ill

“To all who dumbly suffered
His tongue and pen he offered
His life was not his own
Nor lived for self alone

“Hater of din and riot
He lived in days unquiet
And lover of all beauty
Trod the hard ways of duty

“He meant no wrong to any
He sought the good of many
Yet knew both sin and folly—
May God forgive him wholly”"

through cartilage a body broken Animal
and animal as mineral ash A window smashed
The collective howl as a general alarm

Fernando PessoaAutopsychography"The poet is a man who feigns
And feigns so thoroughly at last
He manages to feign as pain
The pain he really feels

And those who read what once he wrote
Feel clearly in the pain they read
Neither of the pains he felt
Only a pain they cannot sense

And thus around its jolting track
There runs to keep our reason busy
The circling clockwork train of ours
That men agree to call a heart"
Alice CaryAutumn"Shorter and shorter now the twilight clips
The days as though the sunset gates they crowd
And Summer from her golden collar slips
And strays through stubble-fields and moans aloud

Save when by fits the warmer air deceives
And stealing hopeful to some sheltered bower
She lies on pillows of the yellow leaves
And tries the old tunes over for an hour

The wind whose tender whisper in the May
Set all the young blooms listening through th’ grove
Sits rustling in the faded boughs to-day
And makes his cold and unsuccessful love

The rose has taken off her tire of red—
The mullein-stalk its yellow stars have lost
And the proud meadow-pink hangs down her head
Against earth’s chilly bosom witched with frost

The robin that was busy all the June
Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough
Catching our hearts up in his golden tune
Has given place to the brown cricket now

The very cock crows lonesomely at morn—
Each flag and fern the shrinking stream divides—
Uneasy cattle low and lambs forlorn
Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides

Shut up the door who loves me must not look
Upon the withered world but haste to bring
His lighted candle and his story-book
And live with me the poetry of Spring"
Joan MitchellAutumn"The rusty leaves crunch and crackle
Blue haze hangs from the dimmed sky
The fields are matted with sun-tanned stalks —
Wind rushes by

The last red berries hang from the thorn-tree
The last red leaves fall to the ground
Bleakness through the trees and bushes
Comes without sound"
Richard GarciaAutumn"Both lying on our sides making love in
spoon position when she’s startled What’s that
She means the enormous ship passing before you—
maybe not that large is it a freighter

or a passenger ship But it seems huge in the dark
and it’s so close That’s a poem you say D H
Lawrence—Have you built your ship of death
have you O build your ship of death

for you will need it Right here it would be good
if there were a small orchestra on board you’d hear
them and say to her That piece is called Autumn

that’s what the brave musicians played as the Titanic
went under—and then you could name this poem “Autumn”
But no the ship is silent its white lights glow in the darkness"

Sydney LeaAutumn"Why not write something for those
who scratched out improbable livings here
Someone has managed to sow
This broken field with stones it appears

So someone’s scratching it still
Although that Japanese knotweed has edged
The tilth Two wasps in the child
Attempt to catch sun on a rail of the bridge

The old local doctor has passed
At almost a full decade past ninety
He never seemed depressed
Seventy now if barely

I consider the field again
Someone will drag these rocks away
But they’ll be back The air smells like rain
Which is fine the summer’s been much too dry

Nothing is left of the barn
But some rusty steel straps in some nasty red osier
The stone fence still looks sound
But even there the knotweed steps over

Hadn’t I pledged an elegy
To the old ones who worked here You couldn’t claim
They thrived exactly but maybe
They likewise scented good wind full of rain

Lifted eyes above this old orchard
To the cloud-darkened hills and found their support
Somehow somewhere No matter
They kept going until they could go no more

The trees’ puckered apples have gathered
A flock of birds and as they alight
They’re full of unseasonable chatter
As if to say that all will be right

The old ones I promised a poem
Must have said it tooIt’ll be all right
I never knew them They’re gone
I say it out loudIt’ll be all right

T E HulmeAutumn"A touch of cold in the Autumn night—
I walked abroad
And saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge
Like a red-faced farmer
I did not stop to speak but nodded
And round about were the wistful stars
With white faces like town children"
John ClareAutumn"The thistledowns flying though the winds are all still
On the green grass now lying now mounting the hill
The spring from the fountain now boils like a pot
Through stones past the counting it bubbles red-hot

The ground parched and cracked is like overbaked bread
The greensward all wracked is bents dried up and dead
The fallow fields glitter like water indeed
And gossamers twitter flung from weed unto weed

Hill-tops like hot iron glitter bright in the sun
And the rivers were eying burn to gold as they run
Burning hot is the ground liquid gold is the air
Whoever looks round sees Eternity there"
Adam ZagajewskiAutumn"Autumn is always too early
The peonies are still blooming bees
are still working out ideal states
and the cold bayonets of autumn
suddenly glint in the fields and the wind
rages

What is its origin Why should it destroy
dreams arbors memories
The alien enters the hushed woods
anger advancing insinuating plague
woodsmoke the raucous howls
of Tatars

Autumn rips away leaves names
fruit it covers the borders and paths
extinguishes lamps and tapers young
autumn lips purpled embraces
mortal creatures stealing
their existence

Sap flows sacrificed blood
wine oil wild rivers
yellow rivers swollen with corpses
the curse flowing on mud lava avalanche
gush

Breathless autumn racing blue
knives glinting in her glance
She scythes names like herbs with her keen
sickle merciless in her blaze
and her breath Anonymous letter terror

I think of Polacks nursing long beers in Tiltonsville
And gray faces of Negroes in the blast furnace at Benwood
And the ruptured night watchman of Wheeling Steel
Dreaming of heroes

All the proud fathers are ashamed to go home
Their women cluck like starved pullets
Dying for love

Therefore
Their sons grow suicidally beautiful
At the beginning of October
And gallop terribly against each other’s bodies"
Jacqueline OsherowAutumn Psalm"A full year passed the seasons keep me honest
since I last noticed this same commotion
Who knew God was an abstract expressionist

I’m asking myself—the very question
I asked last year staring out at this array
of racing colors then set in motion

by the chance invasion of a Steller’s jay
Is this what people mean by speed of light
My usually levelheaded mulberry tree

hurling arrows everywhere in sight—
its bow the out-of-control Virginia creeper
my friends say I should do something about

whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper
at the provocation of the upstart blue
the leaves half green half gold suddenly hyper

in savage competition with that red and blue—
tohubohu returned in living color
Kandinsky where were you when I needed you

My attempted poem would lie fallow a year
I was so busy focusing on the desert’s
stinginess with everything but rumor

No place even for the spectrum’s introverts—
rose olive gray—no pigment at all—
and certainly no room for shameless braggarts

like the ones that barge in here every fall
and make me feel like an unredeemed failure
even more emphatically than usual

And here they are again their fleet allure
still more urgent this time—the desert’s gone
I’m through with it want something fuller—

why shouldn’t a person have a little fun
some utterly unnecessary extravagance
Which was—at least I think it was—God’s plan

when He set up such things are never left to chance
that one split-second assignation
with genuine no-kidding-around omnipotence

what for lack of better words I’m calling vision
You breathe in and for once there’s something there
Just when you thought you’d learned some resignation

there’s real resistance in the nearby air
until the entire universe is swayed
Even that desert of yours isn’t quite so bare

and God’s not nonexistent He’s just been waylaid
by a host of what no one could’ve foreseen
He’s got plans for you this red-gold-green parade

is actually a fairly detailed outline
David never needed one but he’s long dead
and God could use a little recognition

He promises It won’t go to His head
and if you praise Him properly an autumn psalm
Why didn’t I think of that you’ll have it made

But while it’s true that my Virginia creeper praises Him
its palms and fingers crimson with applause
that the local breeze is weaving Him a diadem

inspecting my tree’s uncut gold for flaws
I came to talk about the way that violet-blue
sprang the greens and reds and yellows

into action actual motion I swear it’s true
though I’m not sure I ever took it in
Now I’d be prepared if some magician flew

into my field of vision to realign
that dazzle out my window yet again
It’s not likely but I’m keeping my eyes open

though I still wouldn’t be able to explain
precisely what happened to these vines these trees
It isn’t available in my tradition

For this I would have to be Chinese
Wang Wei to be precise on a mountain
autumn rain converging on the trees

a cassia flower nearby a cloud a pine
washerwomen heading home for the day
my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune

that when my stroke of blue arrives I’m ready
Though there is no rain here the air’s shot through
with gold on golden leaves Wang Wei’s so giddy

he’s calling back the deadLi Bai Du Fu
Guys You’ve got to see this—autumn sun"
Charles GhignaAutumns Way"In their yellow-most goings
leaves of maple
ride breezes to the ground
You can hear their sound
each autumn afternoon
as the crisp air cuts
through the trees
and hurries us along
the golden sidewalks
home"
Edgar BowersAutumn Shade"

The autumn shade is thin Grey leaves lie faint
Where they will lie and where the thick green was
Light stands up like a presence to the sky
The trees seem merely shadows of its age
From off the hill I hear the logging crew
The furious and indifferent saw the slow
Response of heavy pine and I recall
That goddesses have died when their trees died
Often in summer drinking from the spring
I sensed in its cool breath and in its voice
A living form darker than any shade
And without feature passionate yet chill
With lust to fix in ice the buoyant rim—
Ancient of days the mother of us all
Now toward his destined passion there the strong
Vivid young man reluctant may return
From suffering in his own experience
To lie down in the darkness In this time
I stay in doors I do my work I sleep
Each morning when I wake I assent to wake
The shadow of my fist moves on this page
Though even now in the wood beneath a bank
Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks the snake
Does as it must and sinks into the cold




Nights grow colder The Hunter and the Bear
Follow their tranquil course outside my window
I feel the gentian waiting in the wood
Blossoms waxy and blue and blue-green stems
Of the amaryllis waiting in the garden
I know as though I waited what they wait
The cold that fastens ice about the root
A heavenly form the same in all its changes
Inimitable terrible and still
And beautiful as frost Fire warms my room
Its light declares my books and pictures Gently
A dead soprano sings Mozart and Bach
I drink bourbon then go to bed and sleep
In the Promethean heat of summer’s essence




Awakened by some fear I watch the sky
Compelled as though by purposes they know
The stars in their blue distance still affirm
The bond of heaven and earth the ancient way
This old assurance haunts small creatures dazed
In icy mud though cold may freeze them there
And leave them as they are all summer long
I cannot sleep Passion and consequence
The brutal given and all I have desired
Evade me and the lucid majesty
That warmed the dull barbarian to life
So I lie here left with self-consciousness
Enemy whom I love but whom his change
And his forgetfulness again compel
Impassioned toward my lost indifference
Faithful but to an absence Who shares my bed
Who lies beside me certain of his waking
Led sleeping by his own dream to the day




If I ask you angel will you come and lead
This ache to speech or carry me like a child
To riot Ever young you come of age
Remote a pledge of distances this pang
I notice at dusk watching you subside
From tree-tops and from fields Mysterious self
Image of the fabulous alien
Even in sleep you summon me even there
When under his native tree Odysseus hears
His own incredible past and future whispered
By wisdom but by wisdom in disguise




Thinking of a bravura deed a place
Sacred to a divinity an old
Verse that seems new I postulate a man
Mastered by his own image of himself
Who is it says
I am
Sensuous angel
Vessel of nerve and blood the impoverished heir
Of an awareness other than his own
Not these but one to come For there he is
In a steel helmet raging fearing his death
Carrying bread and water to a quiet
Placing ten sounds together in one sound
Confirming his election or merely still
Sleeping or in a colloquy with the sun




Snow and then rain The roads are wet A car
Slips and strains in the mire and I remember
Driving in France weapons-carriers and jeeps
Our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud our minds
Diverted from fear We labor Overhead
A plane Berlin or Frankfurt now New York
The car pulls clear My neighbor smiles He is old
Was this our wisdom simply in a chance
In danger to be mastered by a task
Like groping round a chair through a door to bed




A dormant season and under the dripping tree
Not sovereign ordering nothing letting the past
Do with me as it will I savor place
And weather air and sun Though Hercules
Confronts his nature in his deed repeats
His purposes and is his will intact
Magnificent and memorable I try
The simplest forms of our old poverty
I seek no end appointed in my absence
Beyond the silence I already share




I drive home with the books that I will read
The streets are harsh with traffic Where I once
Played as a boy amid old stands of pine
Row after row of houses Lined by the new
Debris of wealth and power the broken road
Then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground
At last in the minor hills my father’s place
Where I can find my way as in a thought—
Gardens the trees we planted all we share
A Cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting
I see it when I look up from the page




In nameless warmth sun light in every corner
Bending my body over my glowing book
I share the room Is it with a voice or touch
Or look as of an absence learned by love
Now merely mine Annunciation specter
Of the worn out lost or broken telling what future
What vivid loss to come you change the room
And him who reads here Restless he will stir
Look round and see the room renewed and line
Color and shape as in desire they are
Not shadows but substantial light explicit
Bright as glass inexhaustible and true


O

My shadow moves until at noon I stand
Within its seal as in the finished past
But in the place where effect and cause are joined
In the warmth or cold of my remembering
Of love of partial freedom the time to be
Trembles and glitters again in windy light
For nothing is disposed The slow soft wind
Tilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge
The intimate cry both sinister and tender
Once heard is heard confined in its reserve
My image of myself apart informed
By many deaths resists me and I stay
Almost as I have been intact aware
Alive though proud and cautious even afraid"
Charles SimicAutumn Sky"In my great grandmothers time
All one needed was a broom
To get to see places
And give the geese a chase in the sky

•

The stars know everything
So we try to read their minds
As distant as they are
We choose to whisper in their presence

•

Oh Cynthia
Take a clock that has lost its hands
For a ride
Get me a room at Hotel Eternity
Where Time likes to stop now and then

•

Come lovers of dark corners
The sky says
And sit in one of my dark corners
There are tasty little zeroes
In the peanut dish tonight"
Dante Gabriel RossettiAutumn Song"Knowst thou not at the fall of the leaf
How the heart feels a languid grief
Laid on it for a covering
And how sleep seems a goodly thing
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf

And how the swift beat of the brain
Falters because it is in vain
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf
Knowest thou not and how the chief
Of joys seems—not to suffer pain

Knowst thou not at the fall of the leaf
How the soul feels like a dried sheaf
Bound up at length for harvesting
And how death seems a comely thing
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf"
Edith WhartonAn Autumn Sunset"I

Leaguered in fire
The wild black promontories of the coast extend
Their savage silhouettes
The sun in universal carnage sets
And halting higher
The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats
Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned
That balked yet stands at bay
Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day
In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline
A wan Valkyrie whose wide pinions shine
Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray
And in her hand swings high o’erhead
Above the waster of war
The silver torch-light of the evening star
Wherewith to search the faces of the dead


II

Lagooned in gold
Seem not those jetty promontories rather
The outposts of some ancient land forlorn
Uncomforted of morn
Where old oblivions gather
The melancholy unconsoling fold
Of all things that go utterly to death
And mix no more no more
With life’s perpetually awakening breath
Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore
Over such sailless seas
To walk with hope’s slain importunities
In miserable marriage Nay shall not
All things be there forgot
Save the sea’s golden barrier and the black
Close-crouching promontories
Dead to all shames forgotten of all glories
Shall I not wander there a shadow’s shade
A spectre self-destroyed
So purged of all remembrance and sucked back
Into the primal void
That should we on the shore phantasmal meet
I should not know the coming of your feet"
James K BaxterAutumn Testament "As I come down the hill from Toro Poutini’s house
My feet are sore being bare on the sharp stones

And that is a suitable penance The dust of the pa road
Is cool though and I can see

The axe of the moon shift down behind the trees
Very slowly The red light from the windows

Of the church has a ghostly look and in
This place ghosts are real The bees are humming loudly

In moonlight in their old hive above the church door
Where I go in to kneel and come out to make my way

Uphill past a startled horse who plunges in the paddock
Above the nunnery Now there are one or two

Of the tribe back in the big house—What would you have me do
King Jesus Your games with me have turned me into a boulder"
Simon ArmitageAvalon"To the Metropolitan Police Force London
the asylum gates are locked and chained but undone
by wandering thoughts and the close study of maps
So from San Francisco patron city of tramps
I scribble this note having overshot Gloucester
by several million strides having walked on water

City of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats
of snakes-and-ladders streets and cadged cigarettes
city of pelicans fish bones and flaking paint
of underfoot cable-car wires strained to breaking point    
I eat little — a beard of grass a pinch of oats —
let the salt-tide scour and purge me inside and out
but my mind still phosphoresces with lightning strikes
and I straddle each earthquake one foot either side
of the fault line rocking the world’s seesaw
At dusk the Golden Gate Bridge is heaven’s seashore
I watch boats heading home with the day’s catch
or ferrying souls to glittering Alcatraz
or I face west and let the Pacific slip
in bloodshot glory over the planet’s lip
sense the waterfall at the end of the journey

I am ever your countryman Ivor Gurney"
Algernon Charles SwinburneAve Atque Vale"In Memory of Charles Baudelaire

Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs
Les morts les pauvres morts ont de grandes douleurs
Et quand Octobre souffle émondeur des vieux arbres
Son vent mélancolique
à
lentour de leurs marbres
Certe ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats

Les Fleurs du Mal
I
Shall I strew on thee rose or rue or laurel
Brother on this that was the veil of thee
Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the sea
Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or sorrel
Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads weave
Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at eve
Or wilt thou rather as on earth before
Half-faded fiery blossoms pale with heat
And full of bitter summer but more sweet
To thee than gleanings of a northern shore
Trod by no tropic feet

II
For always thee the fervid languid glories
Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies
Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs
Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories
The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave
That knows not where is that Leucadian grave
Which hides too deep the supreme head of song
Ah salt and sterile as her kisses were
The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear
Hither and thither and vex and work her wrong
Blind gods that cannot spare

III
Thou sawest in thine old singing season brother
Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us
Fierce loves and lovely leaf-buds poisonous
Bare to thy subtler eye but for none other
Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime
The hidden harvest of luxurious time
Sin without shape and pleasure without speech
And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep
Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep
And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each
Seeing as men sow men reap

IV
O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping
That were athirst for sleep and no more life
And no more love for peace and no more strife
Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping
Spirit and body and all the springs of song
Is it well now where love can do no wrong
Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang
Behind the unopening closure of her lips
Is it not well where soul from body slips
And flesh from bone divides without a pang
As dew from flower-bell drips

V
It is enough the end and the beginning
Are one thing to thee who art past the end
O hand unclasped of unbeholden friend
For thee no fruits to pluck no palms for winning
No triumph and no labour and no lust
Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust
O quiet eyes wherein the light saith nought
Whereto the day is dumb nor any night
With obscure finger silences your sight
Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought
Sleep and have sleep for light

VI
Now all strange hours and all strange loves are over
Dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet
Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet
Of some pale Titan-woman like a lover
Such as thy vision here solicited
Under the shadow of her fair vast head
The deep division of prodigious breasts
The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep
The weight of awful tresses that still keep
The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests
Where the wet hill-winds weep

VII
Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision
O gardener of strange flowers what bud what bloom
Hast thou found sown what gathered in the gloom
What of despair of rapture of derision
What of life is there what of ill or good
Are the fruits grey like dust or bright like blood
Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours
The faint fields quicken any terrene root
In low lands where the sun and moon are mute
And all the stars keep silence Are there flowers
At all or any fruit

VIII
Alas but though my flying song flies after
O sweet strange elder singer thy more fleet
Singing and footprints of thy fleeter feet
Some dim derision of mysterious laughter
From the blind tongueless warders of the dead
Some gainless glimpse of Proserpines veiled head
Some little sound of unregarded tears
Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes
And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs —
These only these the hearkening spirit hears
Sees only such things rise

IX
Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow
Far too far off for thought or any prayer
What ails us with thee who art wind and air
What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow
Yet with some fancy yet with some desire
Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire
Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find
Still and more swift than they the thin flame flies
The low light fails us in elusive skies
Still the foiled earnest ear is deaf and blind
Are still the eluded eyes

X
Not thee O never thee in all times changes
Not thee but this the sound of thy sad soul
The shadow of thy swift spirit this shut scroll
I lay my hand on and not death estranges
My spirit from communion of thy song —
These memories and these melodies that throng
Veiled porches of a Muse funereal —
These I salute these touch these clasp and fold
As though a hand were in my hand to hold
Or through mine ears a mourning musical
Of many mourners rolled

XI
I among these I also in such station
As when the pyre was charred and piled the sods
And offering to the dead made and their gods
The old mourners had standing to make libation
I stand and to the gods and to the dead
Do reverence without prayer or praise and shed
Offering to these unknown the gods of gloom
And what of honey and spice my seedlands bear
And what I may of fruits in this chilled air
And lay Orestes-like across the tomb
A curl of severed hair

XII
But by no hand nor any treason stricken
Not like the low-lying head of Him the King
The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing
Thou liest and on this dust no tears could quicken
There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear
Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear
Down the opening leaves of holy poets pages
Thee not Orestes not Electra mourns
But bending us-ward with memorial urns
The most high Muses that fulfil all ages
Weep and our Gods heart yearns

XIII
For sparing of his sacred strength not often
Among us darkling here the lord of light
Makes manifest his music and his might
In hearts that open and in lips that soften
With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine
Thy lips indeed he touched with bitter wine
And nourished them indeed with bitter bread
Yet surely from his hand thy souls food came
The fire that scarred thy spirit at his flame
Was lighted and thine hungering heart he fed
Who feeds our hearts with fame

XIV
Therefore he too now at thy souls sunsetting
God of all suns and songs he too bends down
To mix his laurel with thy cypress crown
And save thy dust from blame and from forgetting
Therefore he too seeing all thou wert and art
Compassionate with sad and sacred heart
Mourns thee of many his children the last dead
And hallows with strange tears and alien sighs
Thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes
And over thine irrevocable head
Sheds light from the under skies

XV
And one weeps with him in the ways Lethean
And stains with tears her changing bosom chill
That obscure Venus of the hollow hill
That thing transformed which was the Cytherean
With lips that lost their Grecian laugh divine
Long since and face no more called Erycine
A ghost a bitter and luxurious god
Thee also with fair flesh and singing spell
Did she a sad and second prey compel
Into the footless places once more trod
And shadows hot from hell

XVI
And now no sacred staff shall break in blossom
No choral salutation lure to light
A spirit sick with perfume and sweet night
And loves tired eyes and hands and barren bosom
There is no help for these things none to mend
And none to mar not all our songs O friend
Will make death clear or make life durable
Howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine
And with wild notes about this dust of thine
At least I fill the place where white dreams dwell
And wreathe an unseen shrine

XVII
Sleep and if life was bitter to thee pardon
If sweet give thanks thou hast no more to live
And to give thanks is good and to forgive
Out of the mystic and the mournful garden
Where all day through thine hands in barren braid
Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade
Green buds of sorrow and sin and remnants grey
Sweet-smelling pale with poison sanguine-hearted
Passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started
Shall death not bring us all as thee one day
Among the days departed

XVIII
For thee O now a silent soul my brother
Take at my hands this garland and farewell
Thin is the leaf and chill the wintry smell
And chill the solemn earth a fatal mother
With sadder than the Niobean womb
And in the hollow of her breasts a tomb
Content thee howsoeer whose days are done
There lies not any troublous thing before
Nor sight nor sound to war against thee more
For whom all winds are quiet as the sun
All waters as the shore"
Frank OHaraAve Maria"Mothers of America
let your kids go to the movies
get them out of the house so they won’t know what you’re up to
it’s true that fresh air is good for the body
but what about the soul
that grows in darkness embossed by silvery images
and when you grow old as grow old you must
they won’t hate you
they won’t criticize you they won’t know
they’ll be in some glamorous country
they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey

they may even be grateful to you
for their first sexual experience
which only cost you a quarter
and didn’t upset the peaceful home
they will know where candy bars come from
and gratuitous bags of popcorn
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it’s over
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg
near the Williamsburg Bridge
oh mothers you will have made the little tykes
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies
they won’t know the difference
and if somebody does it’ll be sheer gravy
and they’ll have been truly entertained either way
instead of hanging around the yard
or up in their room
hating you
prematurely since you won’t have done anything horribly mean yet
except keeping them from the darker joys
it’s unforgivable the latter
so don’t blame me if you won’t take this advice
and the family breaks up
and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set
seeing
movies you wouldn’t let them see when they were young"

of caulkless houses
among the charley noble chimneypots
of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines
a woman pastes up sails
upon the wind
hanging out her morning sheets
with wooden pins
O lovely mammal
her nearly naked breasts
throw taut shadows
when she stretches up
to hang at last the last of her
so white washed sins
but it is wetly amorous
and winds itself about her
clinging to her skin
So caught with arms
upraised
she tosses back her head
in voiceless laughter
and in choiceless gesture then
shakes out gold hair

between the blown white shrouds

Joshua McCarter SimpsonAway to Canada"Adapted to the case of Mr S
Fugitive from Tennessee

I’m on my way to Canada
That cold and dreary land
The dire effects of slavery
I can no longer stand
My soul is vexed within me so
To think that I’m a slave
I’ve now resolved to strike the blow
For freedom or the grave

O righteous Father
Wilt thou not pity me
And aid me on to Canada
Where colored men are free

I heard Victoria plainly say
If we would all forsake
Our native land of slavery
And come across the Lake
That she was standing on the shore
With arms extended wide
To give us all a peaceful home
Beyond the rolling tide

Farewell old master
That’s enough for me—
I’m going straight to Canada
Where colored men are free

I heard the old-soul driver say
As he was passing by
That darkey’s bound to run away
I see it in his eye
My heart responded to the charge
And thought it was no crime
And something seemed my mind to urge
That now’s the very time

O old driver
Don’t you cry for me
I’m going up to Canada
Where colored men are free

Grieve not my wife—grieve not for me
O do not break my heart
For nought but cruel slavery
Would cause me to depart
If I should stay to quell your grief
Your grief I would augment
For no one knows the day that we
Asunder might be rent

O Susannah
Don’t you cry for me—
I’m going up to Canada
Where colored men are free

I heard old master pray last night—
I heard him pray for me
That God would come and in his might
From Satan set me free
So I from Satan would escape
And flee the wrath to come—
If there’s a fiend in human shape
Old master must be one

O old master
While you pray for me
I’m doing all I can to reach
The land of Liberty

Ohio’s not the place for me
For I was much surprised
So many of her sons to see
In garments of disguise
Her name has gone out through the world
Free Labor Soil and Men
But slaves had better far be hurled
Into the Lion’s Den

Farewell Ohio
I am not safe in thee
I’ll travel on to Canada
Where colored men are free

I’ve now embarked for yonder shore
Where man’s a man by law
The vessel soon will bear me o’er
To shake the Lion’s paw
I no more dread the Auctioneer
Nor fear the master’s frowns
I no more tremble when I hear
The beying negro-hounds

O old Master
Don’t think hard of me—
I’m just in sight of Canada
Where colored men are free

I’ve landed safe upon the shore
Both soul and body free
My blood and brain and tears no more
Will drench old Tennesse
But I behold the scalding tear
Now stealing from my eye
To think my wife—my only dear
A slave must live and die

O Susannah
Don’t grieve after me—
For ever at a throne of grace
I will remember thee"
Dara WierAwe of Everything"Do you know what’s the unluckiest thing
In the world a differential grasshopper
Said to me I paused I put down the
Diesel grinder I’d been trying to fix
I turned off the stealth bomber I faded
Away from the faded away pedals I put up
Finely embroidered silk panels over the
Faces of the statues I pulled the green
Vacillating amplifier into the hallway
I swiveled seven of the chains and
Loosened the bolts in the balcony I went
Into the barn to unlace the cattle and
Overturn the empty buckets I put the
White flag on the mailbox I cut the
Telephone wires I fed the ducks better
Than I usually feed them I adjusted the
Faucets so they’d drip a little I waved
At old Mr Wiley with his smokeless pipe
And his manpowered plough across the field
I moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge
I taped the key to the bulldozer to the
Roof of the canopy I took the cup of
Auger bits away from the rabbit hutch
I put a padlock on the children’s playhouse
I picked up a stick by the sideyard gate
I broke it over my knee I went to the well
To fill a stone pitcher with cool water
I let the donkey amp the goats go I took
A ladder to the hayloft and took down a
Suitcase I could see across the valley
Down to the river from up there"
James Thomas StevensThe Awful Ease of Tides"for Arthur Sze
I

Somehow precise and unquestionable
the cut of the Chinese man’s hair
Never before this certainty
I consider the decision of each strand
The diameter The angle
So black the way it appears
crashing against the hard corner of his jaw


II

I consider the darkness
You are appointed court photographer Consider this picture


III

My small face is red behind a bath towel curtain
I watch a funeral that is taking place next door
So black my dog
hurling himself against a chain link fence


IV

The casket is lowered and I am removing rusty pins
from the grease on the window’s aluminum track
along with strands of hair


V

This is pressing
I mark it with an asterisk Black and large


VI

A vague feeling
pressing itself against a snowfence in my mind
Like a threat I view the way you cut your hair
as if it were a history of something small"
Michael CollierAn Awful Story"When she came into his room he was asleep
and when she touched him he woke—
her hand on his shoulder her knee at his mouth
and in the darkness she looked like a boy

When he tried to sit up she covered his ears
with her hands “Save ourselves from ourselves”
she said and then a wind stirred in the room
as if she’d placed those words in his mouth"
Bonny CassidyAxe Derby"Never were knuckle-men
Choked up on planks

of smoke they haul
towards the peplum stabbing

back at time splinters of it
flip like cars Rolled sleeves

knees cooked the rousie
is flirting with her broom a blonde

with criminal simplicity with
historical truth we can detoxify

a poisoned planet Now
they’re descending the spirit heap

dribbling pinkies along fair knotty thighs
Children are returning to pick up the butts

Still the brunette is caving in the face
of time is making herself a living

treasure from this surplus
hour the minutes fly"
Gary SnyderAxe Handles"One afternoon the last week in April
Showing Kai how to throw a hatchet
One-half turn and it sticks in a stump
He recalls the hatchet-head
Without a handle in the shop
And go gets it and wants it for his own
A broken-off axe handle behind the door
Is long enough for a hatchet
We cut it to length and take it
With the hatchet head
And working hatchet to the wood block
There I begin to shape the old handle
With the hatchet and the phrase
First learned from Ezra Pound
Rings in my ears
""When making an axe handle
the pattern is not far off""
And I say this to Kai
""Look Well shape the handle
By checking the handle
Of the axe we cut with—""
And he sees And I hear it again
Its in Lu Jis Wên Fu fourth century
AD ""Essay on Literature""-—in the
Preface ""In making the handle
Of an axe
By cutting wood with an axe
The model is indeed near at hand""
My teacher Shih-hsiang Chen
Translated that and taught it years ago
And I see Pound was an axe
Chen was an axe I am an axe
And my son a handle soon
To be shaping again model
And tool craft of culture
How we go on"
Ray GonzalezAxis"The volcano in my grandmothers Mexican village
smothered the town though the girl escaped because
the axis of revolution sent her family into exile

black clouds covering their journey to the north
The axis of the earth is a skeletal bone extending
from pole to pole the arm of someone holding on

The Japanese earthquake shifted the axis of the earth
moving Japan twelve feet closer to North America
each day shortened by one second

When a poet said the past never happens because
it is always present the other one proclaimed the past
is in the future the axis bending to allow these words

to skip the water like stones thrown by a boy in
search of his father the axis of yesterday sinking
the stones the boy hurled across the pond"

Sabrina Orah MarkThe Babies"Some thought it was because of all the babies I suddenly seemed to be having Others that I should pay for the damages Fact is I wasn’t getting any older so I bought a small aquarium and skipped town Took up with a toy store owner until he left me for a more beautiful robot Took up with a reader of instructional booklets Never mind I was lost By the time I arrived at Mrs Greenaway’s it was clear I was nowhere at all In exchange for room and board I’d rearrange her furniture her birthmarks her quiet animals until they took on more satisfying shapes Sometimes the shapes were simple like a mustache or a pipe Sometimes they were more complicated arrangements like the one of dead Mr Greenaway’s closed barbershop Over the years as Mrs Greenaway and I became more and more vague the shapes did too For identification purposes we’d give them names like She Wasn’t Fooling Anyone She Was Hurt and She Was Hurt Bad or The Insides of Doctors One night when I was working on a piece I thought I’d call Symphony Symphony the shapes began to slip out of my hands At first as Mrs Greenaway remembers the sound of broken glass Then the trumpets Then the terrible music of all those babies I once seemed to be suddenly having marching like soldiers in rows Then their round wet bellies coming towards me Mrs Greenaway still talks about how expertly they gathered me into their tiny arms And how they took me away not like a prisoner But like a mother Into a past I still swear I never had"
Julien PoirierThe Baboon Is Eating Strawberries"The baboon is eating strawberries
expired on the shelf
of the Ft Bragg Safeway
A coastal landscape
with waves
like inexpertly torn tinfoil hangs
above his left shoulder
at the check-in desk
of an abandoned motel
The ocean itself
is only a sound
through a torn window screen
where some hardscrabble bush
about to flower
is just a smell
Will something appropriately
random please
happen to convince me
reality is still playing
with a full deck"
Neal LevinBaby Ate a Microchip"Baby ate a microchip
Then grabbed a bottle took a sip
He swallowed it and made a beep
And now he’s thinking pretty deep

He’s downloading his ABCs
And calculating --s
He’s memorizing useless facts
While doing Daddy’s income tax

He’s processing and now he thrives
On feeding his internal drives
He’s throwing fits and now he fights
With ruthless bits and toothless bytes

He must be feeling very smug
But hold on Baby caught a bug
Attempting to reboot in haste
He accidentally got erased"
Bernadette Mayer"Baby Come Today October th""Ecstatic experiences with nature
This is an automatic furnace
Do not drop or roll
Do not handle with squeeze lift truck
Handle with care
This is a piece of quality assured
Home heating and cooling equipment
The Ohio Valley Container Corporation
Made its container to stand
A resistance bursting test
Of over  pounds per square inch
Not an inch a metaphor
These words are on my window
There is no pane the first frost comes
The second baby well have to
Turn up the heat eat nothing
And breathe through a rose
Emulating the butterflys patterns
And the repetitive indifference of leaves
Turning pink color of the rose so flushed
Orange color color of trees
Ecstatic mists train us no feeling
No feeling only moving beginning
The pane crashed baby falls
Between loose pelvis onto the sheet
Watches leaves blow wind onto window
Ecstatic poets bend over watch the thin doctor
Hes in the light this is a chore or task
Leaves blow the rose upside down up and down the street
Interior blowing toward muscles and thighs
Bending up and down pictures of people
The butterfly replaces the hat
Every inch of the sheet is ironed
Practice matches a new sculptureof thought in ephemeral
stretching
The space is no bigger than needed
Air and water all around pennies in water
I foresee a taste for display in blowing up and down
The crown describes only fantastic gems in air
No loose signs of what the teas will do for you
Fear a moment of taking longer than the warmth lasts
The visitors and the coaches then speak of their intention
For time to deny any atrophy or waste even the giggles
Later longer than warmth not in inches
But in wrappings of leaves for warmth and evenness
The warm colors the cold blue curtains between the sun and the moon
After pretension to be singly devoted to ones task is swayed to love
Then the simple movement from inside to outside
Become astonishment red yellow orange and eyes bright
Sophia Crystal foretells as I foresee absence of memory who
sings eternally
Only to sing more and more"
Ann TaylorThe Babys Dance"DANCE little baby dance up high
Never mind baby mother is by 
Crow and caper caper and crow
There little baby there you go 
Up to the ceiling down to the ground
Backwards and forwards round and round 
Dance little baby and mother shall sing
With the merry coral ding ding ding"
Philip LevineBaby Villon"He tells me in Bangkok he’s robbed
Because he’s white in London because he’s black
In Barcelona Jew in Paris Arab
Everywhere and at all times and he fights back

He holds up seven thick little fingers
To show me he’s rated seventh in the world
And there’s no passion in his voice no anger
In the flat brown eyes flecked with blood

He asks me to tell all I can remember
Of my father his uncle he talks of the war
In North Africa and what came after
The loss of his father the loss of his brother

The windows of the bakery smashed and the fresh bread
Dusted with glass the warm smell of rye
So strong he ate till his mouth filled with blood
“Here they live here they live and not die”

And he points down at his black head ridged
With black kinks of hair He touches my hair
Tells me I should never disparage
The stiff bristles that guard the head of the fighter

Sadly his fingers wander over my face
And he says how fair I am how smooth
We stand to end this first and last visit
Stiff  pounds five feet two

No bigger than a girl he holds my shoulders
Kisses my lips his eyes still open
My imaginary brother my cousin
Myself made otherwise by all his pain"
Thomas R SmithBaby Wrens’ Voices"I am a student of wrens
When the mother bird returns
to her brood beak squirming
with winged breakfast a shrill
clamor rises like jingling
from tiny high-pitched bells
Who’d have guessed such a small
house contained so many voices
The sound they make is the pure sound
of life’s hunger Who hangs our house
in the world’s branches and listens
when we sing from our hunger
Because I love best those songs
that shake the house of the singer
I am a student of wrens"
Amiri BarakaBabylon Revisited"The gaunt thing
with no organs
creeps along the streets
of Europe she will
commute in her feathered bat stomach-gown
with no organs
with sores on her insides
even her head
a vast puschamber
of pussy memories
with no organs
nothing to make babies
she will be the great witch of euro-american legend
who sucked the life
from some unknown nigger
whose name will be known
but whose substance will not ever
not even by him
who is dead in a pile of dopeskin

This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob Thompson
a black painter a giant once she reduced
to a pitiful imitation faggot
full of American holes and a monkey on his back
slapped airplanes
from the empire state building

May this bitch and her sisters all of them
receive my words
in all their orifices like lye mixed with
cocola and alaga syrup

feel this shit bitches feel it now laugh your
hysterectic laughs
while your flesh burns
and your eyes peel to red mud"

Betty Joan Perske age nineteen gives that look
the one that shifts tectonic plates to Bogie
and that’s it Germany surrenders
Japan bows its apologies and that sailor
smooches the nurse in Times Square The world

Matthew ArnoldBacchanalia"I

The evening comes the fields are still
The tinkle of the thirsty rill
Unheard all day ascends again
Deserted is the half-mown plain
Silent the swaths the ringing wain
The mowers cry the dogs alarms
All housed within the sleeping farms
The business of the day is done
The last-left haymaker is gone
And from the thyme upon the height
And from the elder-blossom white
And pale dog-roses in the hedge
And from the mint-plant in the sedge
In puffs of balm the night-air blows
The perfume which the day forgoes
And on the pure horizon far
See pulsing with the first-born star
The liquid sky above the hill
The evening comes the fields are still

Loitering and leaping
With saunter with bounds—
Flickering and circling
In files and in rounds—
Gaily their pine-staff green
Tossing in air
Loose oer their shoulders white
Showering their hair—
See the wild Maenads
Break from the wood
Youth and Iacchus
Maddening their blood

See through the quiet land
Rioting they pass—
Fling the fresh heaps about
Trample the grass
Tear from the rifled hedge
Garlands their prize
Fill with their sports the field
Fill with their cries

Shepherd what ails thee then
Shepherd why mute
Forth with thy joyous song
Forth with thy flute
Tempts not the revel blithe
Lure not their cries
Glow not their shoulders smooth
Melt not their eyes
Is not on cheeks like those
Lovely the flush
—Ah so the quiet was
So was the hush

II

The epoch ends the world is still
The age has talkd and workd its fill—
The famous orators have shone
The famous poets sung and gone
The famous men of war have fought
The famous speculators thought
The famous players sculptors wrought
The famous painters filld their wall
The famous critics judged it all
The combatants are parted now—
Uphung the spear unbent the bow
The puissant crownd the weak laid low
And in the after-silence sweet
Now strifes are hushd our ears doth meet
Ascending pure the bell-like fame
Of this or that down-trodden name
Delicate spirits pushd away
In the hot press of the noon-day
And oer the plain where the dead age
Did its now silent warfare wage—
Oer that wide plain now wrapt in gloom
Where many a splendour finds its tomb
Many spent fames and fallen mights—
The one or two immortal lights
Rise slowly up into the sky
To shine there everlastingly
Like stars over the bounding hill
The epoch ends the world is still

Thundering and bursting
In torrents in waves—
Carolling and shouting
Over tombs amid graves—
See on the cumberd plain
Clearing a stage
Scattering the past about
Comes the new age
Bards make new poems
Thinkers new schools
Statesmen new systems
Critics new rules
All things begin again
Life is their prize
Earth with their deeds they fill
Fill with their cries

Poet what ails thee then
Say why so mute
Forth with thy praising voice
Forth with thy flute
Loiterer why sittest thou
Sunk in thy dream
Tempts not the bright new age
Shines not its stream
Look ah what genius
Art science wit
Soldiers like Caesar
Statesmen like Pitt
Sculptors like Phidias
Raphaels in shoals
Poets like Shakespeare—
Beautiful souls
See on their glowing cheeks
Heavenly the flush
—Ah so the silence was
So was the hush

The world but feels the presents spell
The poet feels the past as well
Whatever men have done might do
Whatever thought might think it too"
Ivor GurneyBach and the Sentry"Watching the dark my spirit rose in flood
On that most dearest Prelude of my delight
The low-lying mist lifted its hood
The October stars showed nobly in clear night

When I return and to real music-making
And play that Prelude how will it happen then
Shall I feel as I felt a sentry hardly waking
With a dull sense of No Mans Land again"
David Lee GarrisonBach in the DC Subway"As an experiment
TheWashington Post
asked a concert violinist—
wearing jeans tennis shoes
and a baseball cap—
to stand near a trash can
at rush hour in the subway
and play Bach
on a Stradivarius
Partita No  in D Minor
called out to commuters
like an ocean to waves
sang to the station
about why we should bother
to live

A thousand people
streamed by Seven of them
paused for a minute or so
and thirty-two dollars floated
into the open violin case
A café hostess who drifted
over to the open door
each time she was free
said later that Bach
gave her peace
and all the children
all of them
waded into the music
as if it were water
listening until they had to be
rescued by parents
who had somewhere else to go"
Edgar Albert GuestThe Bachelor’s Soliloquy"To wed or not to wed that is the question
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The bills and house rent of a wedded fortune
Or to say “nit” when she proposes
And by declining cut her To wed to smoke
No more And have a wife at home to mend
The holes in socks and shirts
And underwear and so forth ’Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished To wed for life
To wed perchance to fight ay there’s the rub
For in that married life what fights may come
When we have honeymooning ceased
Must give us pause there’s the respect
That makes the joy of single life
For who would bear her mother’s scornful tongue
Canned goods for tea the dying furnace fire
The pangs of sleepless nights when baby cries
The pain of barking shins upon a chair and
Closing waists that button down the back
When he himself might all these troubles shirk
With a bare refusal Who would bundles bear
And grunt and sweat under a shopping load
Who would samples match buy rats for hair
Cart cheese and crackers home to serve at night
For lunch to feed your friends play pedro
After tea sing rag time songs amusing
Friendly neighbors Buy garden tools
To lend unto the same Stay home at nights
In smoking coat and slippers and slink to bed
At ten o’clock to save the light bills
Thus duty does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of matrimony
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of chores
And thus the gloss of marriage fades away
And loses its attraction"
Jacob SaenzThe Bachelor Watches “The Bachelor”"I sit on the couch amp witness my life
projected on a screen — I am white
w/a chiseled dimpled chin amp no lips
I’m a farmer who lives alone in a loft
amp not a lowly office worker who lives
w/a roommate in an apartment where
dust balls decorate the floors amp walls
amp the ceiling rings w/children’s feet
running back amp forth like baby bulls
I am crazy enough to be a contestant
on a show where I’m contractually obligated
to propose to a woman who believes
in a heteronormative patriarchal
idea of what a family should be
At the end of every episode I offer
roses to those I wish to make out w/more
amp take out on prepackaged romantic dates
I could never afford on my bachelor budget
For example a date in a castle a glass
slipper prop a clock winding its way
down to midnight My date amp I sip
champagne chat amp eat then we dance
to a live orchestra led by a maestro
who wishes he were dead A giant screen appears
amp plays a clip of a live-action Cinderella movie
w/Prince Charming played by an actor
I’ve seen slaughter amp behead a soldier
like clipping the head off a rose
In real life my dates consist of dinner
at Burger King where we dine on chicken
fries amp don paper crowns for a royal feel
On another show date I take two women into South
Dakota where we fly over the heads of white
slave owners carved into a sacred Native mountain
At the end of the date I offer no roses to either
woman amp abandon them on a canopied bed
in the middle of the Badlands amp take off
in a helicopter to provide the cameras
an aerial view of wilderness amp despair
At the end of the show I find myself proposing
to a fertility nurse in a barn made to look
like a chapel amp not the place where I raised
my first horse fucked my first goat Here
I will milk the cows for our future offspring
to drink straight from the teat like I did as a kid
The show ends amp I rise from the couch
amp walk into the kitchen On bended knee
I reach for a bottle of beer deep
in the back of the fridge pop the top
like a question amp take a swig cold
amp crisp once it hits my full lips"

   Launch Audio in a New Window""A garden
late spring honeysuckle and lazy birds

heavy with the round scent

of tuberoses and jungle gardenia


There is a man

in boots that make his thighs

look lethal  with a whip

no spurs

medieval sorrow in his eyes

or around the mouth maybe

He is dangerous

in this place he has

the fertility of steel


There is a woman
in a vine green habit  her
veins are purple her blue
eyes She is blonde
though sometimes brunette"
Peter EverwineBack from the Fields"Until nightfall my son ran in the fields
looking for God knows what
Flowers perhaps Odd birds on the wing
Something to fill an empty spot
Maybe a luminous angel
or a country girl with a secret dark
He came back empty-handed
or so I thought

Now I find them
thistles goatheads
the barbed weeds
all those with hooks or horns
the snaggle-toothed the grinning ones
those wearing lantern jaws
old ones in beards leapers
in silk leggings the multiple
pocked moons and spiny satellites all those
with juices and saps
like the fingers of thieves
nation after nation of grasses
that dig in that burrow that hug winds
and grab handholds
in whatever lean place

It’s been a good day"
Bruce GuernseyBack Road"Winter mornings
driving past
I’d see these kids
huddled like grouse
in the plowed ruts
in front of their shack
waiting for the bus
three small children
bunched against the drifts
rising behind them

This morning
I slowed to wave
and the smallest
a stick of a kid
draped in a coat
grinned and raised
his red raw hand
the snowball
packed with rock
aimed at my face"
Trish CrapoBack Then"Out in the yard my sister and I
tore thread from century plants
to braid into bracelets ate
chalky green bananas
threw coconuts onto the sidewalk
to crack their hard hairy skulls

The world had begun to happen
but not time We would live
forever sunburnt and pricker-stuck
our promises written in blood Not yet

would men or illness distinguish us
our thoughts cleave us in two
If she squeezed sour calamondins
into a potion I drank it When I jumped
from the fig tree she jumped"
Liam RectorBack to Country with Pulitzer"I left here at eight
And returned at 
In between

I largely wasted America
I married had children
Distinguished myself in a profession

Full of fools becoming one myself
As is the way
Of this or I suppose of any other world

I missed
The Nobel but I did bring down
The Pulitzer The weather

The politics the stars
And my own small contribution
All lined up and I got one

So “Pulitzer” became my middle name
Before I came here where no one cares
A whit about such things

I failed at love
That’s where I truly fucked up
I couldn’t

The women in this town
Are mostly severe resentful
—The men bitter disappointed

A perfect place for my purposes
I stay in a room
In the house of an old woman

Who doesn’t want to have sex any more
And neither do I
So we do not

Trouble each other on that front
Which is good
I do like to drink

I used to love to eat
But then I don’t much
Give a shit

About any of that now
The old woman sometimes says wistfully
God will soon be calling both of us

Back home but as an agnostic
I don’t believe that
As an American

I don’t buy that
I came here to retire from love
To face my failure to love

As I attempted to face everything
Else before and that
Is exactly what I am doing and doing

With the exactness I used to put into
My work for which I received the Pulitzer
I hate a coward

My son
Came here the other day and asked
Exactly when I might

Be coming back
And I sent him off without an answer
The answer

Seems to be staying here
Staying honestly here and coming to terms
With my greatest single failure

My wife is dead To me
It seems I am left over
To eat a shit sandwich

“Eat me” the world says
Now that I have lost my appetite
We used to say “Eat me”
To each other in high school
Another thing from which no one
Ever recovers America likes to think

Every one can recover from every thing
But about this
Especially America is wrong"
Lani OHanlonBack Up Quick They’re Hippies"That was the year we drove
into the commune in Cornwall
“Jesus Jim” mam said
“back up quick they’re hippies”

Through the car window
tents row after row flaps open
long-haired men and women
curled around each other like babies

and the babies themselves
wandered naked across the grass

I reached for the handle ready almost
to open the door drop out and away
from my sister’s aggressive thighs
Daddy’s slapping hands

Back home in the Dandelion Market
I unlearnt the steps my mother taught
bought a headband an afghan coat
a fringed skirt — leather skin

Barefoot on common grass I lay down with kin"
Margaret AtwoodBackdrop addresses cowboy"Starspangled cowboy
sauntering out of the almost-
silly West on your face
a porcelain grin
tugging a papier-mâché cactus
on wheels behind you with a string

you are innocent as a bathtub
full of bullets

Your righteous eyes your laconic
trigger-fingers
people the streets with villains
as you move the air in front of you
blossoms with targets

and you leave behind you a heroic
trail of desolation
beer bottles
slaughtered by the side
of the road bird-
skulls bleaching in the sunset

I ought to be watching
from behind a cliff or a cardboard storefront
when the shooting starts hands clasped
in admiration
but I am elsewhere

Then what about me

what about the I
confronting you on that border
you are always trying to cross

I am the horizon
you ride towards the thing you can never lasso

I am also what surrounds you
my brain
scattered with your
tincans bones empty shells
the litter of your invasions

I am the space you desecrate
as you pass through"
Rae ArmantroutBackground Information"


There’s a lot going on in
“the”
zombie apocalypse

But wouldn’t she recognize
that her mother
was a zombie

I mean zombies
are a thing





The last thing she did
was point
to one corner of the ceiling

with a horrified stare
The nurse called this “a seizure”

As if words
drained experience
of content and continued

to accumulate

As if words
were sealed containers
stored for safe keeping





The background
is everything

that for now
can be safely

ignored"
Chika SagawaBackside"Night eats color
Flower bouquets lose their fake ornaments
Day falls into the leaves like sparkling fish
And struggles like the lowly mud
The shapeless dreams and trees
Nurtured outside this shriveled deridable despair
And the space that was chopped down
Tickles the weeds there by its feet
Fingers stained with tar from cigarettes
Caress the writhing darkness
And then the people move forward"
Thulani Davisbackstage drama"for Miami
They all like to hang out
Thinking is all rather grim to them
Snake and Minnie
who love each other dearly
drink in different bars
ride home in separate cars
They like to kiss good night
with unexplored lips
They go out of town
to see each other open
This they do for no one else
Minnie does it all for God
Snake does it all for fame
Backstage is where they play their games
that’s why i know their business

I was gonna talk about a race riot
They say they’ve never played that town
Fleece tells me he’s seen an old movie
about a black town attacking a white one
Sidney Poitier was the young doctor
accused abused and enraged
There were Ossie Davis and Woody Strode
Ruby Dee and a hundred unknowns
Also Sapphire’s mama as a maid
“What was Sapphire’s mama’s name” says Inez
I was going to talk about a race riot
but we were stuck on Kingfish’s mother-in-law
Minnie kisses Snake so he’ll forget about that
and I say “They’re mad they’re on the bottom
going down stung by white justice in a white town
and then there’s other colored people
who don’t necessarily think they’re colored people
leaving them the ground”

“That’s just like the dreads the Coptics
and the Man-ley-ites” one drunk says too loud
“I and I know” say he
Snake yells “Are you crazy No it ain’t
and no we don’t”
“That’s just like Angola” Terri chimes
“Sometimes it’s not who but what
sometimes not what but who”

I’m trying to talk to these people
about this race riot
someone is walking on the bar
and every one of us belongs even now to Miami
to people we have never seen

Pookie and Omar want to know what’s goin’ on
They always do
’cause they’re always in the bathroom
when it’s goin’ on
They do everything together and not for God
and not for fame but for love
At least that’s what their records say
They are a singing group that’s had  Pookies

Omar asks me “What do you want to say”
Inez interupts “She don’t know what to say
she just wants to say something
I understand that”
The th Pookie chirps “This race riot sounds like
all the other race riots”
Fleece says “And you sound like
 other Pookies Pookie”

I am still trying to talk about this race riot
Minnie looks up and says “We don’t have anywhere
to put any more dead”
Snake puts on his coat to leave alone
“We never did we never did”"
Warsan ShireBackwards"for Saaid Shire
The poem can start with him walking backwards into a room
He takes off his jacket and sits down for the rest of his life
that’s how we bring Dad back
I can make the blood run back up my nose ants rushing into a hole
We grow into smaller bodies my breasts disappear
your cheeks soften teeth sink back into gums
I can make us loved just say the word
Give them stumps for hands if even once they touched us without consent
I can write the poem and make it disappear
Step-Dad spits liquor back into glass
Mum’s body rolls back up the stairs the bone pops back into place
maybe she keeps the baby
Maybe we’re okay kid
I’ll rewrite this whole life and this time there’ll be so much love
you won’t be able to see beyond it

You won’t be able to see beyond it
I’ll rewrite this whole life and this time there’ll be so much love
Maybe we’re okay kid
maybe she keeps the baby
Mum’s body rolls back up the stairs the bone pops back into place
Step-Dad spits liquor back into glass
I can write the poem and make it disappear
give them stumps for hands if even once they touched us without consent
I can make us loved just say the word
Your cheeks soften teeth sink back into gums
we grow into smaller bodies my breasts disappear
I can make the blood run back up my nose ants rushing into a hole
that’s how we bringDad back

Lance LarsenBackyard Georgics"It takes a calendar one damp day to declare fall
weeks of dying mums to second the motion



Gone the homeland gone the father nothing left
but invisible north to magnetize your doubts



Not eulogies or hearses but the sandwiches after
estranged cousins chewing under one umbrella



One clock for errands one for midnight
trysts though neither will hurry a slow train



Prairie is not the floor nor sky the coffered ceiling
Even a scarecrow is wise beyond its straw



Look down a river of grass Look up a velvet lost
and found Look inside no straws to drink that dusk



A woman’s watch thieved by a jay—ah to be lifted
like that to be carried like time across lapping waves"
Diane Seussbackyard song"Since it’s just me here I’ve
found the back and stayed
there most of the time in
rain and snow and the
no-moon nights dodging the front
I used to put up like a yard
gussied and groomed all
edged and flower-lined my
bottled life
Uncorked I had a thought I
want the want
I dreamed of wanting once a
quarter cup of sneak-peek
at what prowls in the back at
what sings in the
wet rag space behind the garage back

where the rabbits nest where
I smell something soupish sour and dank and it’s
filled with weeds like rough
cat tongues and
the wind is unfostered untended
now that it’s just me here and
I am so hungry
for the song that grows tall like a weed
grows and grows

When I was a
little girl
my ma said a woman gets
tired and sick
of the front yard of
kissing the backside of a
rose"
Lisa C KruegerBad Girl"When she was ten her father left her
at a Denny’s—You’ll get back

She walked the other way for miles
before a car pulled over a man shouted

You are lost opened his door to her
Beyond him was darkness

No lights no signs no people
telling her what to do

she kept walking Upright strident
terrified by her act

Terrified she was bad
for saving herself"
Susan GriffinThe Bad Mother"The bad mother wakes from dreams
of imperfection trying to be perfection
All night she’s engineered a train
too heavy with supplies
to the interior She fails
The child she loves
has taken on bad habits cigarettes
maybe even drugs She
recognizes liesYou don’t
fool me"
Stephanie BurtBad Newz"Alec Soth ""Kenny and Bill—Bad Newz

They tilt their guitars and stare
Each boy puts one foot toward
Us one where a trailing wire
Would run to an amplifier
If amplifiers were there
Bills Gibson glitters like ore
Kennys Iba

ez hoards

White noise in its black fretboard
Bills double chin shows Is it fair
To mention his pudge Kennys hair
Gets stuck behind one ear
Each of the brothers wears
A T-shirt loose jeans and a pair
Of bruised high-tops A pear-

Shaped garbage bag hugs a steel bar
The big rectangular blur
Behind them looks like the door
To a walk-in refrigerator
Maybe dad is a restaurateur
A diner owner who requires
Kenny to spend six hours

A week moving cases of beer
While Bill chops potatoes or scours
Grease from the checkerboard floor
Bill imagines a national tour
CBGBs The Black Cat Hardcore
Or metal the glow and allure
Of arenas and open-air

Pyrotechnics at dusk a chauffeur
Or do they hope modestly for
Sideman jobs LA burbs the secure
Work of studio engineers
Two boys hold two guitars
In a basement kitchen and care
What you think of them Next year

They promise to practice more
Right now their repertoire
Is six songs seven chords
Five originals and a spare
Reworking of REMs four-
Minute anthem about a lost car

Kenneth RexrothThe Bad Old Days"The summer of nineteen eighteen
I read The Jungle and The
Research Magnificent That fall
My father died and my aunt
Took me to Chicago to live
The first thing I did was to take
A streetcar to the stockyards
In the winter afternoon
Gritty and fetid I walked
Through the filthy snow through the
Squalid streets looking shyly
Into the people’s faces
Those who were home in the daytime
Debauched and exhausted faces
Starved and looted brains faces
Like the faces in the senile
And insane wards of charity
Hospitals Predatory
Faces of little children
Then as the soiled twilight darkened
Under the green gas lamps and the
Sputtering purple arc lamps
The faces of the men coming
Home from work some still alive with
The last pulse of hope or courage
Some sly and bitter some smart and
Silly most of them already
Broken and empty no life
Only blinding tiredness worse
Than any tired animal
The sour smells of a thousand
Suppers of fried potatoes and
Fried cabbage bled into the street
I was giddy and sick and out
Of my misery I felt rising
A terrible anger and out
Of the anger an absolute vow
Today the evil is clean
And prosperous but it is
Everywhere you don’t have to
Take a streetcar to find it
And it is the same evil
And the misery and the
Anger and the vow are the same"
Mark HallidayBad People"The guys who drank quarts of Busch last night
here by the backstop of this baseball diamond
had names given them by their mothers and fathers—
“Jack” and “Kenny” let us say

Jack might be
a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket
he’s twenty-five his gray pants are too loose on his hips
his jaws always have these little black extra hairs
his mother won’t talk to him on the phone
she lives on french fries and ketchup
he hasn’t been able to send her any cash
in the last two years ever since he lost
his job unloading produce trucks at Pathmark
Jack’s father disappeared when he was ten
“No big deal” Jack says “he was a bastard anyway
he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head”
Kenny offers a laugh-noise He’s heard all that before
Kenny is forty-eight a flabby man with reddened skin
he is employed at the Italian Market selling fish
just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell
his female companion Deena left him a note last month
“You owe me $ chocolate $ wine $ cable TV plus
donuts—I have had it—taking lamp and mirror
they are mine” Kenny hasn’t seen her since
He hangs with Jack because Jack talks loud
as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs
could be kept at bay by talking talking loud   

I’m talking gently and imaginatively here
as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off—

Jack and Kenny Or two other guys dark to me with wounds
oozing in Philadelphia ways less ready to narrate
Last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at Casseloni’s
and bought four quarts at the Fireside Tavern
and wandered into this park After one quart of Busch
Jack said he was Lenny Dykstra
and found a stick for his bat “Pitch to me asshole” he said
so Kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle
for want of anything better and Jack swung in the dark and missed
Kenny’s bottle smashed on home plate and Jack heard in the sound
the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade
absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh
when he hit home runs and chased Joan Rundle around the gym
so Jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down
amid the brown shards of Kenny’s bottle
Then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts
and they both grew glum and silent
and when they smashed these bottles it was like
what else would they do Next morning

Nick and I come to the park with a rubber ball
and a miniature bat Nick is not quite three
but he knows the names of all the Phillies starters
and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be
covered with jagged pieces of brown glass Like a good dad
I warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish
a new home plate closer to the mound there’s no trash can
handy “Who put that glass there” Nick wants to know
and to make a long story short I say “Bad People”
Nick says “Bad How come”"
Robert HerrickThe Bad Season Makes the Poet Sad"Dull to myself and almost dead to these
My many fresh and fragrant mistresses
Lost to all music now since everything
Puts on the semblance here of sorrowing
Sick is the land to th heart and doth endure
More dangerous faintings by her desprate cure
But if that golden age would come again
And Charles here rule as he before did reign
If smooth and unperplexd the seasons were
As when the sweet Maria lived here
I should delight to have my curls half drownd
In Tyrian dews and head with roses crownd
And once more yet ere I am laid out dead
Knock at a star with my exalted head"
Hailey LeithauserBad Sheep"Midnight’s merely blue
but me me me I’m
through
and through
sloe cracked soot-
on-a-boot
nicotine spat licorice whip
You can scratch scratch scratch
but I stay underskin true
to ebony ink crowberry pitch
hoist me up by my hooves
and shake till I’m shook I’m still
chock full of coke fuliginous
murk
O there’s swart in my soul
coal by the bag
cinders and slag
scoriac grit so please
come comb
through my fleece with hands pallid
as snow and watch
how they grow tarry raven
stygian ashed—
or if you wish clean me with bleach
I won’t
flinch just char
down to a core of caliginous
marrow
pure carbon atramentous
utterly piceous
shadowed and starless
each clumpity clump
and eclipse of my heart raptly
re-burnishing

Matthew NienowBad Year Anthem"Who can face the sea and not inherit its loneliness
— Olin Ivory
I


Gray sky gray sea —gray mind the man thinks He thinks
To grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water

He mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him

A sea gull beaks a crab flights vertically and drops
it to the rocks The man cracks with laughter

tossing a stone to a stone


II


Working alone means the voice must grow louder
for who can stand to think quietly all through the day’s calculations

I cannot I let the voice grow loud I let the voice
hum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings and count

the increments as I set the fence according to the blade All day

I stand before a blade and push things into its path

I stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me
The smallest particles of   what is removed thicken the air

making a dream inside which one cannot live All day
the voice is learning how to be outside of   the body


III


A man is not a beach nor is he stone though he collects their entirety
in a single thought He works alone and his thoughts begin to
smack of stone His teeth clatter with their collection


IV


A man can hold a secret between his teeth
and it will never leave his mouth for who would listen
to his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hear
anything original He is that he is — the errand and the fool

running to himself over and over only to find that even he
is tired of telling about it To grow old with it

was the task and the question always would he last

A man can believe in the body and have no one

as though he were ghost
or stone nothing to speak at or be heard from


V


All work no pay makes a body bray
Though he may bray —

Though he may bray and bray

forgive him the bit If he tells you his secret
he will have no secret
This is how one sings a sentence into stone"

Ibn Al-`ArabiBaghdad Song"Oh for corniced palace of Baghdad not
the palatial cornices of Sindád al-Híra—

It crowns the gardens cascading below
a virgin unveiled in a perfumed chamber

Wind plays in the branches They bend
Lovers at last coming together

Her neck necklaced by the river Tigris
her lord our master our Imám al-Hádi

Násir Mansúr best of caliphs
who never set out on horseback to war

God bless him long
as a dove on a swaying boughs cooing

Long as smiles flash lightning
and eyes stream like clouds in answer

From a bride like the sun when the mist parts
revealing herself luminous in splendor"
Eleanor WilnerBailing Out-A Poem for the s"Whose woods these are I think I know 
The landings had gone wrong white silk
like shrouds covered the woods
The trees had trapped the flimsy fabric
in their web—everywhere the harnessed bodies
hung—helpless treading air
like water
We thought to float down
easily—a simple thing
like coming home feet first
a welcome from the waiting fields
a gentle fall in clover

We hadn’t counted on this
wilderness the gusts of wind
that took us over we were surprised
by the tenacity of branching wood
its reach and how impenetrable
the place we left and thought we knew
could be
Sometimes now as we sway unwilling
pendulums that mark the time
we still can dream
someone will come and cut us down
There is nothing here but words the calls
we try the dark with—hoping for a human
ear response a rescue party
But all we hear is other
voices like our own other bodies
tangled in the lines
the repetition of a cry from every tree

I can’t help you help me"
Kay RyanBait Goat"There is a
distance where
magnets pull
we feel having
held them
back Likewise
there is a
distance where
words attract
Set one out
like a bait goat
and wait and
seven others
will approach
But watch out
roving packs can
pull your word
away You
find your stake
yanked and some
rough bunch
to thank"
John DonneThe Bait"Come live with me and be my love
And we will some new pleasures prove
Of golden sands and crystal brooks
With silken lines and silver hooks

There will the river whispering run
Warmd by thy eyes more than the sun
And there the enamourd fish will stay
Begging themselves they may betray

When thou wilt swim in that live bath
Each fish which every channel hath
Will amorously to thee swim
Gladder to catch thee than thou him

If thou to be so seen best loth
By sun or moon thou darknest both
And if myself have leave to see
I need not their light having thee

Let others freeze with angling reeds
And cut their legs with shells and weeds
Or treacherously poor fish beset
With strangling snare or windowy net

Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest
Or curious traitors sleeve-silk flies
Bewitch poor fishes wandring eyes

For thee thou needst no such deceit
For thou thyself art thine own bait
That fish that is not catchd thereby
Alas is wiser far than I"
Eric ChockThe Bait"Saturday mornings before
my weekly chores
I used to sneak out of the house
and across the street
grabbing the first grasshopper
walking in the damp California grass
along the stream
Carefully hiding a silver hook
beneath its green wings
Id float it out
across the gentle ripples
towards the end of its life
Just like that
Id give it the hook
and let it ride
All I ever expected for it
was that big-mouth bass
awaiting its arrival
I didnt think
that I was giving up one life
to get another
that even childhood
was full of sacrifice
Id just take the bright green thing
pluck it off its only stalk
and give it away as if
it were mine to give
I knew someone out there
would be fooled
that someone would accept
the precious gift
So I just sent it along
with a plea of a prayer
hoping it would spread its wings this time
and fly across that wet glass sky
no concern for what inspired
its life or mine
only instinct guiding pain
towards the other side"
Aimee NezhukumatathilBaked Goods"Flour on the floor makes my sandals
slip and I tumble into your arms

Too hot to bake this morning but
blueberries begged me to fold them

into moist muffins Sticks of rhubarb
plotted a whole pie The windows

are blown open and a thickfruit tang
sneaks through the wire screen

and into the home of the scowly lady
who lives next door Yesterday a man

in the city was rescued from his apartment
which was filled with a thousand rats

Something about being angry because
his pet python refused to eat He let the bloom

of fur rise rise over the little gnarly blue rug
over the coffee table the kitchen countertops

and pip through each cabinet snip
at the stumpy bags of sugar

the cylinders of salt Our kitchen is a riot
of pots wooden spoons melted butter

So be it Maybe all this baking will quiet
the angry voices next door if only

for a brief whiff I want our summers

to always be like this—a kitchen wrecked
with love a table overflowing with baked goods
warming the already warm air After all the pots

are stacked the goodies cooled and all the counters
wiped clean—let us never be rescued from this mess"
Judith AskewBakery of Lies"My favorite is the cream puff lie
the kind inflated with hot air
expanded to make an heroic-sized story

Another is the cannoli a long lie
well-packed with nutty details
lightly wrapped in flakey truth

A macaroon isnt a little white lie
but its covered
with self-serving coconut

The apple tart carries slices
of sour gossip only
slightly sweetened with truth

Then theres the napoleon
an Iago lie of pernicious intent
layer upon layer of dark deceit"
Tomas TranströmerBalakirevs Dream "Milij Balakirev
- Russian Composer
The black grand piano the gleaming spider
stood trembling in the midst of its music-net

In the concert hall a land was emerging
where the stones were no heavier than dew

But Balakirev fell asleep during the music
and dreamed a dream about the tsars carriage

It rolled along over the cobblestones
straight into the crow-cawing dark

He sat alone in the cab and looked out
but at the same time ran alongside in the road

He knew that the trip had been long
and his watch showed years not hours

There was a field where the plow lay
and the plow was a bird taking flight

There was a bay where the ship lay
ice-bound lights out with people on deck

The carriage glided across that ice and the wheels
spun and spun with a sound of silk

A lesser battleshipSevastopol
He was aboard The crew came forward

""You wont have to die if you can play""
They showed him a peculiar instrument

It looked like a tuba or a phonograph
or a part to some obscure machine

Scared-stiff and helpless he understood this
is the instrument that drives the warship

He turned to the sailor nearest him
desperately signaled with his hands and begged

""Make the sign of the cross like me cross yourself""
The sailor stared somberly like a blind man

stretched his arms out sunk his head down—
he hung as if nailed to the air

The drums beat The drums beat Applause
Balakirev woke up from his dream

The applause-wings pattered around the hall
He watched the man at the grand piano rise

Outside the streets lay blacked-out by the strike
The carriages rolled swiftly through the darkness"
Alice B FogelBalance"Balance is everything is the only
way to hold on
Ive weighed the alternatives the hold
as harbor It isnt safe
to let go But consider the hover
choices made the moment
between later and too late
Hesitation is later regret
too late You cant keep turning
and turning or expecting
to return This earth

is not a wheel it is a rock
that erodes mountain by mountain
And I have been too soft
like sandstone but there is a point
where I stand without a story
immutable and moved solid
as a breath in winter air

I have seen my death and I know
it is my neighbor my brother
my keeper In my life
I am going to keep trying
for the balance

remembering the risks and the value
of extremes and that experience
teaches the length of allowable lean
that it is easier — and wiser —
to balance a stone as if on one toe
though it weigh a hundred pounds

than to push it back against the curve
of its own world"
Dorianne LauxBalance"Im remembering again the day
we stood on the porch and you smoked
while the old man told you
about his basement full of wine
his bad heart and the doctors warning
how he held the dusty bottle out to you
glad he said to give it away
to someone who appreciated
its value and spirit the years
it took to settle into its richness
and worth Im watching again
each cell alive as you reach
for the wine your forearm exposed
below the rolled sleeve the fine hairs
that sweep along the muscle glowing
lifting a little in the afternoon breeze
Im memorizing the shape of the moment
your hand and the small bones
lengthening beneath the skin
as it tightens in the gripping
in the receiving of the gift the exact
texture and color of your skin
and the old mans face reduced
to its essence That
and the brief second
when both of you had a hand on the bottle—
the thing not yet given
not yet taken but held
between you stoppered full
And my body is flooded again
with an elemental joy
holding onto it against another day
in the unknowable future when Im given
terrible news some dark burden
Ill be forced to carry I know
this is useless and cant possibly work
but Im saving that moment for balance"

E Ethelbert MillerBaldwin"you lie in bed listening
waiting fearing the moment
your father returns home you
listen to voices talking in the
next room and wonder why you are
still afraid of the dark his voice
in the other room you would love to

dark but the blackness is there like
his back if only he would
open the door and look at you maybe
the light would be in his eyes

Cathy Tagnak RexfordBaleen Scrimshaw as mm Film"Shoot in  mm film capture her sitting under

an olive-green archway

Loop the sound of steel striking glass

When you blink the camera captures

the frame of her kin walking upside down

Loop the sound of tundra grass sprouting


Her hairline marks her shift    from caribou to woman

Standing in front of three white spotlights

the silhouette of five black arrowheads

departs from her lips


Splice together her eyelashes and

frozen lids    exaggerate the strain

of her freckles coiled into song


Inukshuks tumble from the tips of her fingernails

guiding the landing strip for twin otters

they watch their children travel to the moon

or perhaps they erase our oiled webs


Chart sixteen luminaries into the Beaufort Sea

Wait  Wait    Wait

The shutter will remember

their white crested etchings


They resurface in the lyric of your documentary"
John BerrymanThe Ball Poem"What is the boy now who has lost his ball
What what is he to do I saw it go
Merrily bouncing down the street and then
Merrily over—there it is in the water
No use to say O there are other balls
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
As he stands rigid trembling staring down
All his young days into the harbour where
His ball went I would not intrude on him
A dime another ball is worthless Now
He senses first responsibility
In a world of possessions People will take balls
Balls will be lost always little boy
And no one buys a ball back Money is external
He is learning well behind his desperate eyes
The epistemology of loss how to stand up
Knowing what every man must one day know
And most know many days how to stand up
And gradually light returns to the street
A whistle blows the ball is out of sight
Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
Floor of the harbour   I am everywhere
I suffer and move my mind and my heart move
With all that move me under the water
Or whistling I am not a little boy"

of who we are
presses into
the green baize

track of crackle

The pressure is
intense and the

Franklin Pierce AdamsA Ballad of Baseball Burdens"The burden of hard hitting Slug away
Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb
Else fandom shouteth “Who said you could play
Back to the jasper league you minor slob”
Swat hit connect line out get on the job
Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom’s ire
Biff bang it clout it hit it on the knob—
This is the end of every fan’s desire

The burden of good pitching Curved or straight
Or in or out or haply up or down
To puzzle him that standeth by the plate
To lessen so to speak his bat-renoun
Like Christy Mathewson or Miner Brown
So pitch that every man can but admire
And offer you the freedom of the town—
This is the end of every fan’s desire

The burden of loud cheering O the sounds
The tumult and the shouting from the throats
Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds
Sitting ay standing sans their hats and coats
A mighty cheer that possibly denotes
That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire
Or as H James would say We’ve got their goats—
This is the end of every fan’s desire

The burden of a pennant O the hope
The tenuous hope the hope that’s half a fear
The lengthy season and the boundless dope
And the bromidic “Wait until next year”
O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear
O Piece of Bunting flying high and higher
That next October it shall flutter here
This is the end of every fan’s desire

Be that to which most fondly we aspire
For us not Stake but Game not Goal but Race—

Dudley RandallBallad of Birmingham"On the bombing of a church in Birmingham Alabama 
“Mother dear may I go downtown
Instead of out to play
And march the streets of Birmingham
In a Freedom March today”

“No baby no you may not go
For the dogs are fierce and wild
And clubs and hoses guns and jails
Aren’t good for a little child”

“But mother I won’t be alone
Other children will go with me
And march the streets of Birmingham
To make our country free”

“No baby no you may not go
For I fear those guns will fire
But you may go to church instead
And sing in the children’s choir”

She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair
And bathed rose petal sweet
And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands
And white shoes on her feet

The mother smiled to know her child
Was in the sacred place
But that smile was the last smile
To come upon her face

For when she heard the explosion
Her eyes grew wet and wild
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Calling for her child

She clawed through bits of glass and brick
Then lifted out a shoe
“O here’s the shoe my baby wore
But baby where are you”"
Robert W ServiceThe Ballad of Blasphemous Bill"I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie
Whenever wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die —
Whether he die in the light o’ day or under the peak-faced moon
In cabin or dance-hall camp or dive mucklucks or patent shoon
On velvet tundra or virgin peak by glacier drift or draw
In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom by avalanche fang or claw
By battle murder or sudden wealth by pestilence hooch or lead —
I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead

For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss and his mind was mighty sot
On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized boneyard lot
And where he died or how he died it didn’t matter a damn
So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone “epigram”
So I promised him and he paid the price in good cheechako coin
Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin
Then I painted a three-foot slab of pine “Here lies poor Bill MacKie”
And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die

Years passed away and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange
Of a long-deserted line of traps ’way back of the Bighorn range
Of a little hut by the great divide and a white man stiff and still
Lying there by his lonesome self and I figured it must be Bill
So I thought of the contract I’d made with him and I took down from the shelf
The swell black box with the silver plate he’d picked out for hisself
And I packed it full of grub and “hooch” and I slung it on the sleigh
Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day

You know what it’s like in the Yukon wild when it’s sixty-nine below
When the ice-worms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow
When the pine-trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood
And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood
When the stove-pipe smoke breaks sudden off and the sky is weirdly lit
And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a red-hot spit
When the mercury is a frozen ball and the frost-fiend stalks to kill —
Well it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill

Oh the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand
As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land
Half dazed half crazed in the winter wild with its grim heartbreaking woes
And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows
North by the compass North I pressed river and peak and plain
Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again

River and plain and mighty peak — and who could stand unawed
As their summits blazed he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God
North aye North through a land accurst shunned by the scouring brutes
And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes
Till at last I came to a cabin squat built in the side of a hill
And I burst in the door and there on the floor frozen to death lay Bill

Ice white ice like a winding-sheet sheathing each smoke-grimed wall
Ice on the stove-pipe ice on the bed ice gleaming over all
Sparkling ice on the dead man’s chest glittering ice in his hair
Ice on his fingers ice in his heart ice in his glassy stare
Hard as a log and trussed like a frog with his arms and legs outspread
I gazed at the coffin I’d brought for him and I gazed at the gruesome dead
And at last I spoke “Bill liked his joke but still goldarn his eyes
A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies”

Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole
With a little coffin six by three and a grief you can’t control
Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin
And that seems to say “You may try all day but you’ll never jam me in”
I’m not a man of the quitting kind but I never felt so blue
As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I’d do
Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about
And I lit a roaring fire in the stove and I started to thaw Bill out

Well I thawed and thawed for thirteen days but it didn’t seem no good
His arms and legs stuck out like pegs as if they was made of wood
Till at last I said “It ain’t no use — he’s froze too hard to thaw
He’s obstinate and he won’t lie straight so I guess I got to —saw”
So I sawed off poor Bill’s arms and legs and I laid him snug and straight
In the little coffin he picked hisself with the dinky silver plate
And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down
Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh and I started back to town

So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep
And there he’s waiting the Great Clean-up when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep
And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun
And sometimes I wonder if they was the awful things I done
And as I sit and the parson talks expounding of the Law
I often think of poor old Bill —and how hard he was to saw"
Algernon Charles SwinburneA Ballad of Death"Kneel down fair Love and fill thyself with tears
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
Upon the sides of mirth
Cover thy lips and eyelids let thine ears
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
Upon the flesh to cleave
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing
And many sorrows after each his wise
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve

O Loves lute heard about the lands of death
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein
O Love and Time and Sin
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath
Three lovers each one evil spoken of
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
Came softer with her praise
Abide a little for our ladys love
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine
And more than peace the passage of her days

O Love thou knowest if she were good to see
O Time thou shalt not find in any land
Till cast out of thine hand
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee
Another woman fashioned like as this
O Sin thou knowest that all thy shame in her
Was made a goodly thing
Yea she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss
With her fair kiss and lips much lovelier
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring

By night there stood over against my bed
Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black
Both sides drawn fully back
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red
And temples drained of purple and full of death
Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
And the seas gold in it
Her eyes were as a doves that sickeneth
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet

Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
Were painted all the secret ways of love
And covered things thereof
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves
And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
Their garment of soft shame
And weeping faces of the wearied loves
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame

The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Made mine own bitter where they ran between
As blood had fallen therein
She saying Arise lift up thine eyes and see
If any glad thing be or any good
Now the best thing is taken forth of us
Even she to whom all praise
Was as one flower in a great multitude
One glorious flower of many and glorious
One day found gracious among many days

Even she whose handmaiden was Love—to whom
At kissing times across her stateliest bed
Kings bowed themselves and shed
Pale wine and honey with the honeycomb
And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering
Even she between whose lips the kiss became
As fire and frankincense
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence

Then I beheld and lo on the other side
My ladys likeness crowned and robed and dead
Sweet still but now not red
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died
And sweet but emptied of the bloods blue shade
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes
And sweet but like spoilt gold
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed
And sweet but as a vesture with new dyes
The body that was clothed with love of old

Ah that my tears filled all her woven hair
And all the hollow bosom of her gown—
Ah that my tears ran down
Even to the place where many kisses were
Even where her parted breast-flowers have place
Even where they are cloven apart—who knows not this
Ah the flowers cleave apart
And their sweet fills the tender interspace
Ah the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart

Ah in the days when God did good to me
Each part about her was a righteous thing
Her mouth an almsgiving
The glory of her garments charity
The beauty of her bosom a good deed
In the good days when God kept sight of us
Love lay upon her eyes
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed
And all her body was more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise

Now ballad gather poppies in thine hands
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
Rain-rotten in rank lands
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
Seek out Deaths face ere the light altereth
And say ""My master that was thrall to Love
Is become thrall to Death""
Bow down before him ballad sigh and groan
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing
For haply it may be
That when thy feet return at evening
Death shall come in with thee"
Algernon Charles Swinburne"A Ballad of François Villon Prince of All Ballad-Makers""Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn
Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years
First of us all and sweetest singer born
Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears
Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears
When song new-born put off the old worlds attire
And felt its tune on her changed lips expire
Writ foremost on the roll of them that came
Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre
Villon our sad bad glad mad brothers name

Alas the joy the sorrow and the scorn
That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears
And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn
And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers
Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears
Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire
Could buy thee bread or kisses when light fame
Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar
Villon our sad bad glad mad brothers name

Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn
Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears
Poor perfect voice most blithe when most forlorn
That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers
Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears
What far delight has cooled the fierce desire
That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire
On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame
But left more sweet than roses to respire
Villon our sad bad glad mad brothers name

Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire
A harlot was thy nurse a God thy sire
Shame soiled thy song and song assoiled thy shame
But from thy feet now death has washed the mire
Love reads out first at head of all our quire
Villon our sad bad glad mad brothers name"
G K ChestertonThe Ballad of God-Makers"A bird flew out at the break of day
From the nest where it had curled
And ere the eve the bird had set
Fear on the kings of the world

The first tree it lit upon
Was green with leaves unshed
The second tree it lit upon
Was red with apples red

The third tree it lit upon
Was barren and was brown
Save for a dead man nailed thereon
On a hill above a town

That night the kings of the earth were gay
And filled the cup and can
Last night the kings of the earth were chill
For dread of a naked man

‘If he speak two more words’ they said
‘The slave is more than the free
If he speak three more words’ they said
‘The stars are under the sea’

Said the King of the East to the King of the West
I wot his frown was set
‘Lo let us slay him and make him as dung
It is well that the world forget’

Said the King of the West to the King of the East
I wot his smile was dread
‘Nay let us slay him and make him a god
It is well that our god be dead’

They set the young man on a hill
They nailed him to a rod
And there in darkness and in blood
They made themselves a god

And the mightiest word was left unsaid
And the world had never a mark
And the strongest man of the sons of men
Went dumb into the dark

Then hymns and harps of praise they brought
Incense and gold and myrrh
And they thronged above the seraphim
The poor dead carpenter

‘Thou art the prince of all’ they sang
‘Ocean and earth and air’
Then the bird flew on to the cruel cross
And hid in the dead man’s hair

‘Thou art the son of the world’ they cried `
‘Speak if our prayers be heard’
And the brown bird stirred in the dead man’s hair
And it seemed that the dead man stirred

Then a shriek went up like the world’s last cry
From all nations under heaven
And a master fell before a slave
And begged to be forgiven

They cowered for dread in his wakened eyes
The ancient wrath to see
And a bird flew out of the dead Christ’s hair
And lit on a lemon tree"
W S MerwinBallad of John Cable and Three Gentlemen"He that had come that morning
One after the other
Over seven hills
Each of a new color

Came now by the last tree
By the red-colored valley
To a gray river
Wide as the sea

There at the shingle
A listing wherry
Awash with dark water
What should it carry

There on the shelving
Three dark gentlemen
Might they direct him
Three gentlemen

“Cable friend John John Cable”
When they saw him they said
“Come and be company
As far as the far side”

“Come follow the feet” they said
“Of your family
Of your old father
That came already this way”

But Cable said “First I must go
Once to my sister again
What will she do come spring
And no man on her garden

She will say ‘Weeds are alive
From here to the Stream of Friday
I grieve for my brother’s plowing’
Then break and cry”

“Lose no sleep” they said “for that fallow
She will say before summer
‘I can get me a daylong man
Do better than a brother’ ”

Cable said “I think of my wife
Dearly she needs consoling
I must go back for a little
For fear she die of grieving”

“Cable” they said “John Cable
Ask no such wild favor
Still if you fear she die soon
The boat might wait for her”

But Cable said “I remember
Out of charity let me
Go shore up my poorly mother
Cries all afternoon”

They said “She is old and far
Far and rheumy with years
And if you like we shall take
No note of her tears”

But Cable said “I am neither
Your hired man nor maid
Your dog nor shadow
Nor your ape to be led”

He said “I must go back
Once I heard someone say
That the hollow Stream of Friday
Is a rank place to lie

And this word now I remember
Makes me sorry have you
Thought of my own body
I was always good to

The frame that was my devotion
And my blessing was
The straight bole whose limbs
Were long as stories—

Now poor thing left in the dirt
By the Stream of Friday
Might not remember me
Half tenderly”

They let him nurse no worry
They said “We give you our word
Poor thing is made of patience
Will not say a word”

“Cable friend John John Cable”
After this they said
“Come with no company
To the far side

To a populous place
A dense city
That shall not be changed
Before much sorrow dry”

Over shaking water
Toward the feet of his father
Leaving the hills’ color
And his poorly mother

And his wife at grieving
And his sister’s fallow
And his body lying
In the rank hollow

Now Cable is carried
On the dark river
Nor even a shadow
Followed him over

On the wide river
Gray as the sea
Flags of white water
Are his company"
Robert HaydenThe Ballad of Nat Turner"Then fled O brethren the wicked juba
and wandered wandered far
from curfew joys in the Dismal’s night
Fool of St Elmo’s fire

In scary night I wandered praying
Lord God my harshener
speak to me now or let me die
speak Lord to this mourner

And came at length to livid trees
where Ibo warriors
hung shadowless turning in wind
that moaned like Africa

Their belltongue bodies dead their eyes
alive with the anger deep
in my own heart Is this the sign
the sign forepromised me

The spirits vanished Afraid and lonely
I wandered on in blackness
Speak to me now or let me die
Die whispered the blackness

And wild things gasped and scuffled in
the night seething shapes
of evil frolicked upon the air
I reeled with fear I prayed

Sudden brightness clove the preying
darkness brightness that was
itself a golden darkness brightness
so bright that it was darkness

And there were angels their faces hidden
from me angels at war
with one another angels in dazzling
combat And oh the splendor

The fearful splendor of that warring
Hide me I cried to rock and bramble
Hide me the rock the bramble cried   
How tell you of that holy battle

The shock of wing on wing and sword
on sword was the tumult of
a taken city burning I cannot
say how long they strove

For the wheel in a turning wheel which is time
in eternity had ceased
its whirling and owl and moccasin
panther and nameless beast

And I were held like creatures fixed
in flaming in fiery amber
But I saw I saw oh many of
those mighty beings waver

Waver and fall go streaking down
into swamp water and the water
hissed and steamed and bubbled and locked
shuddering shuddering over

The fallen and soon was motionless
Then that massive light
began a-folding slowly in
upon itself and I

Beheld the conqueror faces and lo
they were like mine I saw
they were like mine and in joy and terror
wept praising praising Jehovah

Oh praised my honer harshener
till a sleep came over me
a sleep heavy as death And when
I awoke at last free

And purified I rose and prayed
and returned after a time
to the blazing fields to the humbleness
And bided my time"
Muriel RukeyserBallad of Orange and Grape"After you finish your work
after you do your day
after youve read your reading
after youve written your say –
you go down the street to the hot dog stand
one block down and across the way
On a blistering afternoon in East Harlem in the twentieth
century

Most of the windows are boarded up
the rats run out of a sack –
sticking out of the crummy garage
one shiny long Cadillac
at the glass door of the drug-addiction center
a man whod like to break your back
But heres a brown woman with a little girl dressed in rose
and pink too

Frankfurters frankfurters sizzle on the steel
where the hot-dog-man leans –
nothing else on the counter
but the usual two machines
the grape one empty and the orange one empty
I face him in between
A black boy comes along looks at the hot dogs goes on
walking

I watch the man as he stands and pours
in the familiar shape
bright purple in the one marked ORANGE
orange in the one marked GRAPE
the grape drink in the machine marked ORANGE
and orange drink in the GRAPE
Just the one word large and clear unmistakeable on each
machine

I ask him  How can we go on reading
and make sense out of what we read –
How can they write and believe what theyre writing
the young ones across the street
while you go on pouring grape in ORANGE
and orange into the one marked GRAPE –
How are we going to believe what we read and we write
and we hear and we say and we do

He looks at the two machines and he smiles
and he shrugs and smiles and pours again
It could be violence and nonviolence
it could be white and black women and men
it could be war and peace or any
binary system love and hate enemy friend
Yes and no be and not-be what we do and what we dont
do

On a corner in East Harlem
garbage reading a deep smile rape
forgetfulness a hot street of murder
misery withered hope
a man keeps pouring grape into ORANGE
and orange into the one marked GRAPE
pouring orange into GRAPE and grape into ORANGE forever"
George Elliott ClarkeThe Ballad of Othello Clemence"There’s a black wind howlin’ by Whylah Falls
There’s a mad rain hammerin’ the flowers
There’s a shotgunned man moulderin’ in petals
There’s a killer chucklin’ to himself
There’s a mother keenin’ her posied son
There’s a joker amblin’ over his bones
Go down to the Sixhiboux River hear it cry
“Othello Clemence is dead and his murderer’s free”

O sang from Whylah Falls and lived by sweat
Walked that dark road between desire and regret
He pitched lumber crushed rock calloused his hands
He wasn’t a saint but he was a man
Scratch Seville shot him and emptied his skull
Tore a hole in his gut only Death could fill
Now his martyr-mother witnesses in cries
Over his corpse cankered white by lilies

There’s a black wind snakin’ by Whylah Falls
There’s a river of blood in Jarvis County
There’s a government that don’t know how to weep
There’s a mother who can’t get no sleep
Go down to the Sixhiboux hear it moan
Like a childless mother far far from home
“There’s a change that’s gonna have to come
I said a change that’s gonna have to come”"
Oscar WildeThe Ballad of Reading Gaol"I

He did not wear his scarlet coat
For blood and wine are red
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead
The poor dead woman whom he loved
And murdered in her bed

He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby gray
A cricket cap was on his head
And his step seemed light and gay
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky
And at every drifting cloud that went
With sails of silver by

I walked with other souls in pain
Within another ring
And was wondering if the man had done
A great or little thing
When a voice behind me whispered low
""That fellows got to swing""

Dear Christ the very prison walls
Suddenly seemed to reel
And the sky above my head became
Like a casque of scorching steel
And though I was a soul in pain
My pain I could not feel

I only knew what hunted thought
Quickened his step and why
He looked upon the garish day
With such a wistful eye
The man had killed the thing he loved
And so he had to die

Yet each man kills the thing he loves
By each let this be heard
Some do it with a bitter look
Some with a flattering word
The coward does it with a kiss
The brave man with a sword

Some kill their love when they are young
And some when they are old
Some strangle with the hands of Lust
Some with the hands of Gold
The kindest use a knife because
The dead so soon grow cold

Some love too little some too long
Some sell and others buy
Some do the deed with many tears
And some without a sigh
For each man kills the thing he loves
Yet each man does not die

He does not die a death of shame
On a day of dark disgrace
Nor have a noose about his neck
Nor a cloth upon his face
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
Into an empty space

He does not sit with silent men
Who watch him night and day
Who watch him when he tries to weep
And when he tries to pray
Who watch him lest himself should rob
The prison of its prey

He does not wake at dawn to see
Dread figures throng his room
The shivering Chaplain robed in white
The Sheriff stern with gloom
And the Governor all in shiny black
With the yellow face of Doom

He does not rise in piteous haste
To put on convict-clothes
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats and notes
Each new and nerve-twitched pose
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
Are like horrible hammer-blows

He does not know that sickening thirst
That sands ones throat before
The hangman with his gardeners gloves
Slips through the padded door
And binds one with three leathern thongs
That the throat may thirst no more

He does not bend his head to hear
The Burial Office read
Nor while the terror of his soul
Tells him he is not dead
Cross his own coffin as he moves
Into the hideous shed

He does not stare upon the air
Through a little roof of glass
He does not pray with lips of clay
For his agony to pass
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
The kiss of Caiaphas

II

Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard
In the suit of shabby gray
His cricket cap was on his head
And his step seemed light and gay
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
Its ravelled fleeces by

He did not wring his hands as do
Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
In the cave of black Despair
He only looked upon the sun
And drank the morning air

He did not wring his hands nor weep
Nor did he peek or pine
But he drank the air as though it held
Some healthful anodyne
With open mouth he drank the sun
As though it had been wine

And I and all the souls in pain
Who tramped the other ring
Forgot if we ourselves had done
A great or little thing
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
The man who had to swing

For strange it was to see him pass
With a step so light and gay
And strange it was to see him look
So wistfully at the day
And strange it was to think that he
Had such a debt to pay

For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
That in the spring-time shoot
But grim to see is the gallows-tree
With its alder-bitten root
And green or dry a man must die
Before it bears its fruit

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
For which all worldlings try
But who would stand in hempen band
Upon a scaffold high
And through a murderers collar take
His last look at the sky

It is sweet to dance to violins
When Love and Life are fair
To dance to flutes to dance to lutes
Is delicate and rare
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
To dance upon the air

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
We watched him day by day
And wondered if each one of us
Would end the self-same way
For none can tell to what red Hell
His sightless soul may stray

At last the dead man walked no more
Amongst the Trial Men
And I knew that he was standing up
In the black docks dreadful pen
And that never would I see his face
In Gods sweet world again

Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
We had crossed each others way
But we made no sign we said no word
We had no word to say
For we did not meet in the holy night
But in the shameful day

A prison wall was round us both
Two outcast men we were
The world had thrust us from its heart
And God from out His care
And the iron gin that waits for Sin
Had caught us in its snare

III

In Debtors Yard the stones are hard
And the dripping wall is high
So it was there he took the air
Beneath the leaden sky
And by each side a Warder walked
For fear the man might die

Or else he sat with those who watched
His anguish night and day
Who watched him when he rose to weep
And when he crouched to pray
Who watched him lest himself should rob
Their scaffold of its prey

The Governor was strong upon
The Regulations Act
The Doctor said that Death was but
A scientific fact
And twice a day the Chaplain called
And left a little tract

And twice a day he smoked his pipe
And drank his quart of beer
His soul was resolute and held
No hiding-place for fear
He often said that he was glad
The hangmans hands were near

But why he said so strange a thing
No Warder dared to ask
For he to whom a watchers doom
Is given as his task
Must set a lock upon his lips
And make his face a mask

Or else he might be moved and try
To comfort or console
And what should Human Pity do
Pent up in Murderers Hole
What word of grace in such a place
Could help a brothers soul

With slouch and swing around the ring
We trod the Fools Parade
We did not care we knew we were
The Devils Own Brigade
And shaven head and feet of lead
Make a merry masquerade

We tore the tarry rope to shreds
With blunt and bleeding nails
We rubbed the doors and scrubbed the floors
And cleaned the shining rails
And rank by rank we soaped the plank
And clattered with the pails

We sewed the sacks we broke the stones
We turned the dusty drill
We banged the tins and bawled the hymns
And sweated on the mill
But in the heart of every man
Terror was lying still

So still it lay that every day
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave
And we forgot the bitter lot
That waits for fool and knave
Till once as we tramped in from work
We passed an open grave

With yawning mouth the yellow hole
Gaped for a living thing
The very mud cried out for blood
To the thirsty asphalte ring
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
Some prisoner had to swing

Right in we went with soul intent
On Death and Dread and Doom
The hangman with his little bag
Went shuffling through the gloom
And each man trembled as he crept
Into his numbered tomb

That night the empty corridors
Were full of forms of Fear
And up and down the iron town
Stole feet we could not hear
And through the bars that hide the stars
White faces seemed to peer

He lay as one who lies and dreams
In a pleasant meadow-land
The watchers watched him as he slept
And could not understand
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
With a hangman close at hand

But there is no sleep when men must weep
Who never yet have wept
So we—the fool the fraud the knave—
That endless vigil kept
And through each brain on hands of pain
Anothers terror crept

Alas it is a fearful thing
To feel anothers guilt
For right within the sword of Sin
Pierced to its poisoned hilt
And as molten lead were the tears we shed
For the blood we had not spilt

The Warders with their shoes of felt
Crept by each padlocked door
And peeped and saw with eyes of awe
Gray figures on the floor
And wondered why men knelt to pray
Who never prayed before

All through the night we knelt and prayed
Mad mourners of a corse
The troubled plumes of midnight were
The plumes upon a hearse
And bitter wine upon a sponge
Was the savour of Remorse

The gray cock crew the red cock crew
But never came the day
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched
In the corners where we lay
And each evil sprite that walks by night
Before us seemed to play

They glided past they glided fast
Like travellers through a mist
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
Of delicate turn and twist
And with formal pace and loathsome grace
The phantoms kept their tryst

With mop and mow we saw them go
Slim shadows hand in hand
About about in ghostly rout
They trod a saraband
And damned grotesques made arabesques
Like the wind upon the sand

With the pirouettes of marionettes
They tripped on pointed tread
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear
As their grisly masque they led
And loud they sang and long they sang
For they sang to wake the dead

""Oho""
they cried
""the world is wide

But fettered limbs go lame

And once or twice to throw the dice

Is a gentlemanly game

But he does not win who plays with Sin

In the Secret House of Shame""


No things of air these antics were
That frolicked with such glee
To men whose lives were held in gyves
And whose feet might not go free
Ah wounds of Christ they were living things
Most terrible to see

Around around they waltzed and wound
Some wheeled in smirking pairs
With the mincing step of a demirep
Some sidled up the stairs
And with subtle sneer and fawning leer
Each helped us at our prayers

The morning wind began to moan
But still the night went on
Through its giant loom the web of gloom
Crept till each thread was spun
And as we prayed we grew afraid
Of the Justice of the Sun

The moaning wind went wandering round
The weeping prison-wall
Till like a wheel of turning steel
We felt the minutes crawl
O moaning wind what had we done
To have such a seneschal

At last I saw the shadowed bars
Like a lattice wrought in lead
Move right across the whitewashed wall
That faced my three-plank bed
And I knew that somewhere in the world
Gods dreadful dawn was red

At six oclock we cleaned our cells
At seven all was still
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
The prison seemed to fill
For the Lord of Death with icy breath
Had entered in to kill

He did not pass in purple pomp
Nor ride a moon-white steed
Three yards of cord and a sliding board
Are all the gallows need
So with rope of shame the Herald came
To do the secret deed

We were as men who through a fen
Of filthy darkness grope
We did not dare to breathe a prayer
Or to give our anguish scope
Something was dead in each of us
And what was dead was Hope

For Mans grim Justice goes its way
And will not swerve aside
It slays the weak it slays the strong
It has a deadly stride
With iron heel it slays the strong
The monstrous parricide

We waited for the stroke of eight
Each tongue was thick with thirst
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
That makes a man accursed
And Fate will use a running noose
For the best man and the worst

We had no other thing to do
Save to wait for the sign to come
So like things of stone in a valley lone
Quiet we sat and dumb
But each mans heart beat thick and quick
Like a madman on a drum

With sudden shock the prison-clock
Smote on the shivering air
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Of impotent despair
Like the sound the frightened marshes hear
From some leper in his lair

And as one sees most fearful things
In the crystal of a dream
We saw the greasy hempen rope
Hooked to the blackened beam
And heard the prayer the hangmans snare
Strangled into a scream

And all the woe that moved him so
That he gave that bitter cry
And the wild regrets and the bloody sweats
None knew so well as I
For he who lives more lives than one
More deaths than one must die

IV

There is no chapel on the day
On which they hang a man
The Chaplains heart is far too sick
Or his face is far too wan
Or there is that written in his eyes
Which none should look upon

So they kept us close till nigh on noon
And then they rang the bell
And the Warders with their jingling keys
Opened each listening cell
And down the iron stair we tramped
Each from his separate Hell

Out into Gods sweet air we went
But not in wonted way
For this mans face was white with fear
And that mans face was gray
And I never saw sad men who looked
So wistfully at the day

I never saw sad men who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
We prisoners called the sky
And at every careless cloud that passed
In happy freedom by

But there were those amongst us all
Who walked with downcast head
And knew that had each got his due
They should have died instead
He had but killed a thing that lived
Whilst they had killed the dead

For he who sins a second time
Wakes a dead soul to pain
And draws it from its spotted shroud
And makes it bleed again
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood
And makes it bleed in vain

Like ape or clown in monstrous garb
With crooked arrows starred
Silently we went round and round
The slippery asphalte yard
Silently we went round and round
And no man spoke a word

Silently we went round and round
And through each hollow mind
The Memory of dreadful things
Rushed like a dreadful wind
And Horror stalked before each man
And Terror crept behind

The Warders strutted up and down
And kept their herd of brutes
Their uniforms were spick and span
And they wore their Sunday suits
But we knew the work they had been at
By the quicklime on their boots

For where a grave had opened wide
There was no grave at all
Only a stretch of mud and sand
By the hideous prison-wall
And a little heap of burning lime
That the man should have his pall

For he has a pall this wretched man
Such as few men can claim
Deep down below a prison-yard
Naked for greater shame
He lies with fetters on each foot
Wrapt in a sheet of flame

And all the while the burning lime
Eats flesh and bone away
It eats the brittle bone by night
And the soft flesh by day
It eats the flesh and bone by turns
But it eats the heart alway

For three long years they will not sow
Or root or seedling there
For three long years the unblessed spot
Will sterile be and bare
And look upon the wondering sky
With unreproachful stare

They think a murderers heart would taint
Each simple seed they sow
It is not true Gods kindly earth
Is kindlier than men know
And the red rose would but glow more red
The white rose whiter blow

Out of his mouth a red red rose
Out of his heart a white
For who can say by what strange way
Christ brings His will to light
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
Bloomed in the great Popes sight

But neither milk-white rose nor red
May bloom in prison air
The shard the pebble and the flint
Are what they give us there
For flowers have been known to heal
A common mans despair

So never will wine-red rose or white
Petal by petal fall
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
By the hideous prison-wall
To tell the men who tramp the yard
That Gods Son died for all

Yet though the hideous prison-wall
Still hems him round and round
And a spirit may not walk by night
That is with fetters bound
And a spirit may but weep that lies
In such unholy ground

He is at peace—this wretched man—
At peace or will be soon
There is no thing to make him mad
Nor does Terror walk at noon
For the lampless Earth in which he lies
Has neither Sun nor Moon

They hanged him as a beast is hanged
They did not even toll
A requiem that might have brought
Rest to his startled soul
But hurriedly they took him out
And hid him in a hole

They stripped him of his canvas clothes
And gave him to the flies
They mocked the swollen purple throat
And the stark and staring eyes
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
In which their convict lies

The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
By his dishonoured grave
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
That Christ for sinners gave
Because the man was one of those
Whom Christ came down to save

Yet all is well he has but passed
To Lifes appointed bourne
And alien tears will fill for him
Pitys long-broken urn
For his mourners will be outcast men
And outcasts always mourn

V

I know not whether Laws be right
Or whether Laws be wrong
All that we know who lie in gaol
Is that the wall is strong
And that each day is like a year
A year whose days are long

But this I know that every Law
That men have made for Man
Since first Man took his brothers life
And the sad world began
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
With a most evil fan

This too I know—and wise it were
If each could know the same—
That every prison that men build
Is built with bricks of shame
And bound with bars lest Christ should see
How men their brothers maim

With bars they blur the gracious moon
And blind the goodly sun
And they do well to hide their Hell
For in it things are done
That Son of God nor son of Man
Ever should look upon

The vilest deeds like poison weeds
Bloom well in prison-air
It is only what is good in Man
That wastes and withers there
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate
And the Warder is Despair

For they starve the little frightened child
Till it weeps both night and day
And they scourge the weak and flog the fool
And gibe the old and gray
And some grow mad and all grow bad
And none a word may say

Each narrow cell in which we dwell
Is a foul and dark latrine
And the fetid breath of living Death
Chokes up each grated screen
And all but Lust is turned to dust
In Humanitys machine

The brackish water that we drink
Creeps with a loathsome slime
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
Is full of chalk and lime
And Sleep will not lie down but walks
Wild-eyed and cries to Time

But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
Like asp with adder fight
We have little care of prison fare
For what chills and kills outright
Is that every stone one lifts by day
Becomes ones heart by night

With midnight always in ones heart
And twilight in ones cell
We turn the crank or tear the rope
Each in his separate Hell
And the silence is more awful far
Than the sound of a brazen bell

And never a human voice comes near
To speak a gentle word
And the eye that watches through the door
Is pitiless and hard
And by all forgot we rot and rot
With soul and body marred

And thus we rust Lifes iron chain
Degraded and alone
And some men curse and some men weep
And some men make no moan
But Gods eternal Laws are kind
And break the heart of stone

And every human heart that breaks
In prison-cell or yard
Is as that broken box that gave
Its treasure to the Lord
And filled the unclean lepers house
With the scent of costliest nard

Ah happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in

And he of the swollen purple throat
And the stark and staring eyes
Waits for the holy hands that took
The Thief to Paradise
And a broken and a contrite heart
The Lord will not despise

The man in red who reads the Law
Gave him three weeks of life
Three little weeks in which to heal
His soul of his souls strife
And cleanse from every blot of blood
The hand that held the knife

And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand
The hand that held the steel
For only blood can wipe out blood
And only tears can heal
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
Became Christs snow-white seal

VI

In Reading gaol by Reading town
There is a pit of shame
And in it lies a wretched man
Eaten by teeth of flame
In a burning winding-sheet he lies
And his grave has got no name

And there till Christ call forth the dead
In silence let him lie
No need to waste the foolish tear
Or heave the windy sigh
The man had killed the thing he loved
And so he had to die

And all men kill the thing they love
By all let this be heard
Some do it with a bitter look
Some with a flattering word
The coward does it with a kiss
The brave man with a sword"
Gwendolyn BrooksThe Ballad of Rudolph Reed"Rudolph Reed was oaken
His wife was oaken too
And his two good girls and his good little man
Oakened as they grew

“I am not hungry for berries
I am not hungry for bread
But hungry hungry for a house
Where at night a man in bed

”May never hear the plaster
Stir as if in pain
May never hear the roaches
Falling like fat rain

“Where never wife and children need
Go blinking through the gloom
Where every room of many rooms
Will be full of room

”Oh my home may have its east or west
Or north or south behind it
All I know is I shall know it
And fight for it when I find it“

It was in a street of bitter white
That he made his application
For Rudolph Reed was oakener
Than others in the nation

The agent’s steep and steady stare
Corroded to a grin
Why you black old tough old hell of a man
Move your family in"
Henry CareyThe Ballad of Sally in our Alley"The ARGUMENT

A Vulgar Error having long prevailed among many Persons who imagine Sally Salisbury the Subject of this Ballad the Author begs leave to undeceive and assure them it has not the least allusion to her he being a stranger to her very Name at the time this Song was composed For as Innocence and Virtue were ever the Boundaries of his Muse so in this little Poem he had no other view than to set forth the Beauty of a chaste and disinterested Passion even in the lowest Class of human Life The real Occasion was this A Shoemaker’s ’Prentice making Holiday with his Sweet-heart treated her with a sight of Bedlam the Puppet-shews the Flying-chairs and all the Elegancies of the Moorfields From whence proceeding to the Farthing Pye-house he gave her a Collation of Buns Cheesecakes Gammon of Bacon Stuff’d-beef and Bottled-ale through all which Scenes the Author dodged them charm’d with the Simplicity of their Courtship from whence he drew this little Sketch of Nature but being then young and obscure he was very much ridicul’d by some of his Acquaintance for this Performance which nevertheless made its way into the polite World and amply recompenced him by the Applause of the divine Addison who was pleased more than once to mention it with Approbation
Of all the Girls that are so smart
There’s none like pretty SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley
There is no Lady in the Land
Is half so sweet as SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

Her Father he makes Cabbage-nets
And through the Streets does cry ’em
Her Mother she sells Laces long
To such as please to buy ’em
But sure such Folks could ne’er beget
So sweet a Girl as SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

When she is by I leave my Work
I love her so sincerely
My Master comes like any Turk
And bangs me most severely
But let him bang his Belly full
I’ll bear it all for SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

Of all the Days that’s in the Week
I dearly love but one Day
And that’s the Day that comes betwixt
A Saturday and Monday
For then I’m drest all in my best
To walk abroad with SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

My Master carries me to Church
And often am I blamed
Because I leave him in the lurch
As soon as Text is named
I leave the Church in Sermon time
And slink away to SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

When Christmas comes about again
O then I shall have Money
I’ll hoard it up and Box and all
I’ll give it to my Honey
And would it were ten thousand Pounds
I’d give it all to SALLY
She is the Darling of my Heart
And she lives in our Alley

My Master and the Neighbours all
Make game of me and SALLY
And but for her I’d better be
A Slave and row a Galley
But when my seven long Years are out
O then I’ll marry SALLY
O then we’ll wed and then we’ll bed
But not in our Alley"
Delmore SchwartzThe Ballad of the Children of the Czar"


The children of the Czar
Played with a bouncing ball

In the May morning in the Czar’s garden
Tossing it back and forth

It fell among the flowerbeds
Or fled to the north gate

A daylight moon hung up
In the Western sky bald white

Like Papa’s face said Sister
Hurling the white ball forth





While I ate a baked potato
Six thousand miles apart

In Brooklyn in 
Aged two irrational

When Franklin D Roosevelt
Was an Arrow Collar ad

O Nicholas Alas Alas
My grandfather coughed in your army

Hid in a wine-stinking barrel
For three days in Bucharest

Then left for America
To become a king himself





I am my father’s father
You are your children’s guilt

In history’s pity and terror
The child is Aeneas again

Troy is in the nursery
The rocking horse is on fire

Child labor The child must carry
His fathers on his back

But seeing that so much is past
And that history has no ruth

For the individual
Who drinks tea who catches cold

Let anger be general
I hate an abstract thing





Brother and sister bounced
The bounding unbroken ball

The shattering sun fell down
Like swords upon their play

Moving eastward among the stars
Toward February and October

But the Maywind brushed their cheeks
Like a mother watching sleep

And if for a moment they fight
Over the bouncing ball

And sister pinches brother
And brother kicks her shins

Well The heart of man is known
It is a cactus bloom





The ground on which the ball bounces
Is another bouncing ball

The wheeling whirling world
Makes no will glad

Spinning in its spotlight darkness
It is too big for their hands

A pitiless purposeless Thing
Arbitrary and unspent

Made for no play for no children
But chasing only itself

The innocent are overtaken
They are not innocent

They are their father’s fathers
The past is inevitable





Now in another October
Of this tragic star

I see my second year
I eat my baked potato

It is my buttered world
But poked by my unlearned hand

It falls from the highchair down
And I begin to howl

And I see the ball roll under
The iron gate which is locked

Sister is screaming brother is howling
The ball has evaded their will

Even a bouncing ball
Is uncontrollable

And is under the garden wall
I am overtaken by terror

Thinking of my father’s fathers
And of my own will"
Marion McCreadyBallad of the Clyde’s Water"After Lorca
mother’s malison



The burr of the wind is seeping through the door
pink stumps of rhubarb are breaking through the soil
Though it is February I have the mind of autumn
Though it is February"
Edna St Vincent MillayThe Ballad of the Harp-Weaver"“Son” said my mother
When I was knee-high
“You’ve need of clothes to cover you
And not a rag have I

“There’s nothing in the house
To make a boy breeches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with
Nor thread to take stitches

“There’s nothing in the house
But a loaf-end of rye
And a harp with a woman’s head
Nobody will buy”
And she began to cry

That was in the early fall
When came the late fall
“Son” she said “the sight of you
Makes your mother’s blood crawl—

“Little skinny shoulder-blades
Sticking through your clothes
And where you’ll get a jacket from
God above knows

“It’s lucky for me lad
Your daddy’s in the ground
And can’t see the way I let
His son go around”
And she made a queer sound

That was in the late fall
When the winter came
I’d not a pair of breeches
Nor a shirt to my name

I couldn’t go to school
Or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys
Passed our way

“Son” said my mother
“Come climb into my lap
And I’ll chafe your little bones
While you take a nap”

And oh but we were silly
For half an hour or more
Me with my long legs
Dragging on the floor

A-rock-rock-rocking
To a mother-goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy
For half an hour’s time

But there was I a great boy
And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
To sleep all day
In such a daft way

Men say the winter
Was bad that year
Fuel was scarce
And food was dear

A wind with a wolf’s head
Howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs
And sat on the floor

All that was left us
Was a chair we couldn’t break
And the harp with a woman’s head
Nobody would take
For song or pity’s sake

The night before Christmas
I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep
Like a two-year-old

And in the deep night
I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me
With love in her eyes

I saw my mother sitting
On the one good chair
A light falling on her
From I couldn’t tell where

Looking nineteen
And not a day older
And the harp with a woman’s head
Leaned against her shoulder

Her thin fingers moving
In the thin tall strings
Were weav-weav-weaving
Wonderful things

Many bright threads
From where I couldn’t see
Were running through the harp-strings
Rapidly

And gold threads whistling
Through my mother’s hand
I saw the web grow
And the pattern expand

She wove a child’s jacket
And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
And wove another one

She wove a red cloak
So regal to see
“She’s made it for a king’s son”
I said “and not for me”
But I knew it was for me

She wove a pair of breeches
Quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots
And a little cocked hat

She wove a pair of mittens
She wove a little blouse
She wove all night
In the still cold house

She sang as she worked
And the harp-strings spoke
Her voice never faltered
And the thread never broke
And when I awoke—

There sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder
Looking nineteen
And not a day older

A smile about her lips
And a light about her head
And her hands in the harp-strings
Frozen dead

And piled up beside her
And toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king’s son
Just my size"
Federico García LorcaBallad of the Moon Moon"For Conchita García Lorca
Moon came to the forge
in her petticoat of nard
The boy looks and looks
the boy looks at the Moon
In the turbulent air
Moon lifts up her arms
showing — pure and sexy —
her beaten-tin breasts
Run Moon run Moon Moon
If the gypsies came
white rings and white necklaces
they would beat from your heart
Boy will you let me dance —
when the gypsies come
they’ll find you on the anvil
with your little eyes shut
Run Moon run Moon Moon
I hear the horses’ hoofs
Leave me boy Don’t walk
on my lane of white starch

The horseman came beating
the drum of the plains
The boy at the forge
has his little eyes shut
Through the olive groves
in bronze and in dreams
here the gypsies come
their heads riding high
their eyelids hanging low

How the night heron sings
how it sings in the tree
Moon crosses the sky
with a boy by the hand

At the forge the gypsies
cry and then scream
The wind watches watches
the wind watches the Moon

Translated from the Spanish"
Kenneth FearingBallad of the Salvation Army"On Fourteenth street the bugles blow
Bugles blow bugles blow
The red red red red banner floats
Where sweating angels split their throats
Marching in burlap petticoats
Blow bugles blow

God is a ten car Bronx express
Red eyes round red eyes round
""Oh where is my lustful lamb tonight
His hair slicked down and his trousers tight
Ill grind him back to my glory light""
Roll subway roll

Heaven is a free amusement park
Big gold dome big gold dome
Movies at night ""The life she led""
Everyone sleeps in one big bed
The stars go around inside your head
Home sweet home

On Fourteenth street the bugles blow
Bugles blow bugles blow
The torpid stones and pavements wake
A million men and street-cars quake
In time with angel breasts that shake
Blow bugles blow"
Ivor GurneyBallad of the Three Spectres"As I went up by Ovillers
In mud and water cold to the knee
There went three jeering fleering spectres
That walked abreast and talked of me

The first said ‘Here’s a right brave soldier
That walks the dark unfearingly
Soon he’ll come back on a fine stretcher
And laughing for a nice Blighty’

The second ‘Read his face old comrade
No kind of lucky chance I see
One day he’ll freeze in mud to the marrow
Then look his last on Picardie’

Though bitter the word of these first twain
Curses the third spat venomously
‘He’ll stay untouched till the war’s last dawning
Then live one hour of agony’

Liars the first two were Behold me
At sloping arms by one – two – three
Waiting the time I shall discover
Whether the third spake verity"
François VillonThe Ballad of Villon and Fat Madge"‘’Tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation’ -Falstaff
‘The night cometh when no man can work’

What though the beauty I love and serve be cheap
Ought you to take me for a beast or fool
All things a man could wish are in her keep
For her I turn swashbuckler in love’s school
When folk drop in I take my pot and stool
And fall to drinking with no more ado
I fetch them bread fruit cheese and water too
I say all’s right so long as I’m well paid
‘Look in again when your flesh troubles you
Inside this brothel where we drive our trade’

But soon the devil’s among us flesh and fell
When penniless to bed comes Madge my whore
I loathe the very sight of her like hell
I snatch gown girdle surcoat all she wore
And tell her these shall stand against her score
She grips her hips with both hands cursing God
Swearing by Jesus’ body bones and blood
That they shall not Then I no whit dismayed
Cross her cracked nose with some stray shiver of wood
Inside this brothel where we drive our trade

When all’s made up she drops me a windy word
Bloat like a beetle puffed and poisonous
Grins thumps my pate and calls me dickey-bird
And cuffs me with a fist that’s ponderous
We sleep like logs being drunken both of us
Then when we wake her womb begins to stir
To save her seed she gets me under her
Wheezing and whining flat as planks are laid
And thus she spoils me for a whoremonger
Inside this brothel where we drive our trade

Blow hail or freeze I’ve bread here baked rent free
Whoring’s my trade and my whore pleases me
Bad cat bad rat we’re just the same if weighed
We that love filth filth follows us you see
Honour flies from us as from her we flee
Inside this brothel where we drive our trade

I bequeath likewise to fat Madge
This little song to learn and study
By god’s head she’s a sweet fat fadge
Devout and soft of flesh and ruddy
I love her with my soul and body
So doth she me sweet dainty thing
If you fall in with such a lady
Read it and give it her to sing"
Thomas MooreA Ballad The Lake of the Dismal Swamp"Written at Norfolk in Virginia
“They made her a grave too cold and damp
For a soul so warm and true
And she’s gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp
Where all night long by a fire-fly lamp
She paddles her white canoe

“And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see
And her paddle I soon shall hear
Long and loving our life shall be
And I’ll hide the maid in a cypress tree
When the footstep of death is near”

Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds—
His path was rugged and sore
Through tangled juniper beds of reeds
Through many a fen where the serpent feeds
And man never trod before

And when on the earth he sunk to sleep
If slumber his eyelids knew
He lay where the deadly vine doth weep
Its venomous tear and nightly steep
The flesh with blistering dew

And near him the she-wolf stirr’d the brake
And the copper-snake breath’d in his ear
Till he starting cried from his dream awake
“Oh when shall I see the dusky Lake
And the white canoe of my dear”

He saw the Lake and a meteor bright
Quick over its surface play’d—
“Welcome” he said “my dear one’s light”
And the dim shore echoed for many a night
The name of the death-cold maid

Till he hollow’d a boat of the birchen bark
Which carried him off from shore
Far far he follow’d the meteor spark
The wind was high and the clouds were dark
And the boat return’d no more

But oft from the Indian hunter’s camp
This lover and maid so true
Are seen at the hour of midnight damp
To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp
And paddle their white canoe"
Sir John Suckling"from
  
  A Ballad Upon A Wedding""I tell thee Dick where I have been
Where I the rarest things have seen
Oh things without compare
Such sights again cannot be found
In any place on English ground
Be it at wake or fair

At Charing-Cross hard by the way
Where we thou know’st do sell our hay
There is a house with stairs
And there did I see coming down
Such folk as are not in our town
Vorty at least in pairs

Amongst the rest one pest’lent fine
His beard no bigger though than thine
Walk’d on before the rest
Our landlord looks like nothing to him
The King God bless him ’twould undo him
Should he go still so drest

At Course-a-Park without all doubt
He should have first been taken out
By all the maids i’th’ town
Though lusty Roger there had been
Or little George upon the Green
Or Vincent of the Crown

But wot you what the youth was going
To make an end of all his wooing
The parson for him stay’d
Yet by his leave for all his haste
He did not so much wish all past
Perchance as did the maid

The maid and thereby hangs a tale
For such a maid no Whitsun-ale
Could ever yet produce
No grape that’s kindly ripe could be
So round so plump so soft as she
Nor half so full of juice

Her finger was so small the ring
Would not stay on which they did bring
It was too wide a peck
And to say truth for out it must
It look’d like the great collar just
About our young colt’s neck

Her feet beneath her petticoat
Like little mice stole in and out
As if they fear’d the light
But oh she dances such a way
No sun upon an Easter-day
Is half so fine a sight

He would have kissed her once or twice
But she would not she was nice
She would not do’t in sight
And then she looked as who should say
I will do what I list to day
And you shall do’t at night

Her cheeks so rare a white was on
No daisy makes comparison
Who sees them is undone
For streaks of red were mingled there
Such as are on a Catherine pear
The side that’s next the sun

Her lips were red and one was thin
Compar’d to that was next her chin
Some bee had stung it newly
But Dick her eyes so guard her face
I durst no more upon them gaze
Than on the sun in July

Her mouth so small when she does speak
Thou’dst swear her teeth her words did break
That they might passage get
But she so handled still the matter
They came as good as ours or better
And are not spent a whit

If wishing should be any sin
The Parson himself had guilty been
She looked that day so purely
And did the youth so oft the feat
At night as some did in conceit
It would have spoil’d him surely

Passion o’ me how I run on
There’s that that would be thought upon
I trow besides the bride
The business of the kitchen’s great
For it is fit that men should eat
Nor was it there denied

Just in the nick the cook knock’d thrice
And all the waiters in a trice
His summons did obey
Each serving-man with dish in hand
March’d boldly up like our train’d band
Presented and away

When all the meat was on the table
What man of knife or teeth was able
To stay to be intreated
And this the very reason was
Before the parson could say grace
The company was seated

Now hats fly off and youths carouse
Healths first go round and then the house
The bride’s came thick and thick
And when ’twas nam’d another’s health
Perhaps he made it hers by stealth
And who could help it Dick

O’ th’ sudden up they rise and dance
Then sit again and sigh and glance
Then dance again and kiss
Thus sev’ral ways the time did pass
Whilst ev’ry woman wish’d her place
And ev’ry man wish’d his

By this time all were stol’n aside
To counsel and undress the Bride
But that he must not know
But yet ’twas thought he guess’d her mind
And did not mean to stay behind
Above an hour or so

When in he came Dick there she lay
Like new-fal’n snow melting away
’Twas time I trow to part
Kisses were now the only stay
Which soon she gave as who would say
Good Boy with all my heart

But just as heav’ns would have to cross it
In came the Bridemaids with the Posset
The Bridegroom eat in spite
For had he left the Women to’t
It would have cost two hours to do’t
Which were too much that night

At length the candles out and out
All that they had not done they do’t
What that is who can tell
But I believe it was no more
Then thou and I have done before
With Bridget and with Nell"
Anne AskewThe Ballad which Anne Askew made and sang when she was in Newgate"Like as the armed knight
Appointed to the field
With this world will I fight
And Faith shall be my shield

Faith is that weapon strong
Which will not fail at need
My foes therefore among
Therewith will I proceed

As it is had in strength
And force of Christes way
It will prevail at length
Though all the devils say nay

Faith in the fathers old
Obtained rightwisness
Which make me very bold
To fear no worlds distress

I now rejoice in heart
And Hope bid me do so
For Christ will take my part
And ease me of my woe

Thou saist lord who so knock
To them wilt thou attend
Undo therefore the lock
And thy strong power send

More enmyes now I have
Than hairs upon my head
Let them not me deprave
But fight thou in my stead

On thee my care I cast
For all their cruel spight
I set not by their haste
For thou art my delight

I am not she that list
My anchor to let fall
For every drizzling mist
My ship substancial

Not oft use I to wright
In prose nor yet in rime
Yet will I shew one sight
That I saw in my time

I saw a rial throne
Where Justice should have sit
But in her stead was one
Of moody cruel wit

Absorpt was rightwisness
As of the raging flood
Sathan in his excess
Suct up the guiltless blood

Then thought I Jesus lord
When thou shalt judge us all
Hard is it to record
On these men what will fall

Yet lord I thee desire
For that they do to me
Let them not taste the hire
Of their iniquity"
Hilaire BellocBallade of Modest Confession"My reading is extremely deep and wide
And as our modern education goes—
Unique I think and skilfully applied
To Art and Industry and Autres Choses
Through many years of scholarly repose
But there is one thing where I disappoint
My numerous admirers and my foes
Painting on Vellum is my weakest point"
Babette DeutschBallet School"Fawns in the winter wood
Who feel their horns and leap
Swans whom the bleakening mood
Of evening stirs from sleep
Tall flowers that unfurl
As a moth driven flies
Flowers with the breasts of a girl
And sea-cold eyes
The bare bright mirrors glow
For their enchanted shapes
Each is a flame and so
Like flame escapes"
John KinsellaBalloon"It didn’t happen in that order—
the endless growl of what will turn out to be
miniature quad and trail bikes carried along
the top of the valley and rumbling its contents
small kids with helmets weighing more than their heads
ragged on by parents with crossed arms and ambition
in their eyes round and round the drone of fun
A country pursuit Tracy tells me a professor
of economics at a local city university
while praising capitalism says he will only
listen to opposition if it comes from one
who eats only lentils has given up cars
and eschews imported brands of foodstuffs Lentils
Contradictions aside I’ll take him on though
it might be hard to hear me speak above the junior
quad-bike circus performing along the hills But hark
I’ll tell you something unusually usual at dusk
wandering the block with Katherine we came across
shreds of chemical-pink balloon with plastic string
attached to its tied-off umbilical cord clearly
an escapee from a party the child—her name
decorating the balloon with three crosses for kisses—
in tears chasing it up into the sky watching
it drift over the hills her letter to the world
a single word and her mark made over Katherine
asks if I recall the balloons her class back in England
released with school name and address and how one
floated all the way over the Channel and on to Belgium
where another child picked up the shreds and deciphered
the message and wrote back weather balloons “hopes
and ambitions” as Delmore says but without doubt
or skepticism in full expectation they will land
somewhere far away and bring joy to the finder
I throw the shred of balloon away fearing
an animal crossing the block in the dark
night-eyed and keenly sampling the ground
and the air with its snout will reread or misread
the code of chemical pinkness and like some Red
Riding Hood in reverse choke on the gift of chance"
Grace SchulmanBalm in Gilead"“Is there no balm in Gilead” So cries
dour Jeremiah in granite tones
“There is a balm in Gilead” replies
a Negro spiritual The baritone

who chants it leaning forward on the platform
looks up not knowing his voice is a rainstorm
that rinses air to reveal earth’s surprises
Today the summer gone four monarch butterflies

their breed’s survivors sucked a flower’s last blooms
opened their wings orange-and-black stained glass
and printed on the sky in zigzag lines
watch bright things rise winter moons the white undersides
of a California condor once thought doomed
now flapping wide like the first bird from ashes"

though they can shoot up thirty feet
if all goes well for them Cut in cross

multi-layered mysteries with ghostly hearts
Their leaves are made to be broken by the wind

if wind there be but the crosswise tears
they are built to expect do them no harm
Around the steady staff of the leafstalk

the broken fronds flap in the breeze
like brief forgotten flags but these
tattered green photosynthetic machines

fold down to touch on each side--
a kind of prayer to clasp what damp they can

Jean ToomerBanking Coal"Whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal
To start the Fire did his part well
Not all wood takes to fire from a match
Nor coal from wood before it’s burned to charcoal
The wood and coal in question caught a flame
And flared up beautifully touching the air
That takes a flame from anything

Somehow the fire was furnaced
And then the time was ripe for some to say
“Right banking of the furnace saves the coal”
I’ve seen them set to work each in his way
Though all with shovels and with ashes
Never resting till the fire seemed most dead
Whereupon they’d crawl in hooded night-caps
Contentedly to bed Sometimes the fire left alone
Would die but like as not spiced tongues
Remaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up
Never strong to anyone who cared to rake for them
But roaring fires never have been made that way
I’d like to tell those folks that one grand flare
Transferred to memory tissues of the air
Is worth a like or for dull minds that turn in gold
All money ever saved by banking coal"

lucky nor crazy a capacious bird

At dawn he milked
the cows then went inside

woke him up
with warm bread and quilts
At nightfall he took out

his rifle—a white-maned
figure stalking the darkened
breast of the Union—and
shot at the stars and by chance
one went out Had he killed

as phrases fold

Valerio MagrelliBar Code"Let us honor the topmost banner
fluttering over the kingdom of commodities—
the encoded soul of price
rose of the name and name of the rose
bundle of stems fasces
of tendons and veins—
wrist on which
to auscultate
the pulse of money"
Moira EganBar Napkin Sonnet #"Things happen when you drink too much mescal
One night with not enough food in my belly
he kept on buyingI’m a girl who’ll fall
damn near in love with gratitude and well he
was hot and generous and so the least
that I could do was let him kiss me hard
and soft and any way you want it beast
and beauty lime and salt—sweet Bacchus’ pards—
and when his friend showed up I felt so warm
and generous I let him kiss me too
His buddy asked me if it was the worm
inside that makes me do the things I do
I wasn’t sure which worm he meant the one
I ateThe one that eats at me alone"
Lynda HullBar Xanadu"A perfect veronica invisible scallops air
before the bull the bartender’s fluttering hands
Tipped with silken fruit tinseled gold
a dusty banderilla hangs above racked bottles
burnt-orange Your lacquered fingers streak
the cocktail napkin and the globe of cognac’s

fragrant on the zinc bar Fields of chamomile
Close your eyes and then the night turns to coal
seamed with diamonds Outside a girl murmurs
her tired price in pesetas to passing men
Irita the barman calls when she wanders in
to wash at the single coldwater tap Just a fly-blown

café on your functionary’s street of flats bedrooms
shuttered around their whispering the shops that gleam
by day with scaled cellophane piglets mounded bins
of fruit and olives Irita rewinds her hair
at the bar a gilt rosette nestling its waves
tattered bullfight posters on the wall behind her

and you think of Rita Hayworth tossing roses
in Blood and Sand the frayed banderilla
Such a lovely thing to torture an animal with
the corrida’s exacting choreography
of life and death Sometimes it’s soothing to evaporate
in this smoke-patinaed air abandoning

your imposter’s life of embassy files breathing
the military names and numbers Torrejón’s
precise cold barracks Your face wavers oddly calm
in the mirror as the girl talks dancing and
flamenco clubs to the barman absinthe glass shining
derangement in his hand It’s the place in the night

where you carve an uneasy confederacy
from vapor and exhaustion a trio—the alien
the clownish poseur the girl with nothing to sell
but herself and straitened cataleptic dreams
She stretches plays idly the slot machines
spinning roses babies and lemons the brilliant

suit of lights The caramel glow of the barlamps haloes
her hair bitten lips Another sip and the slots’
click is rosary beads wafting prayers up
to a heaven of slink and spangle quick bargains
struck in alcoves that old palm of chapped fingers
slipping coins to the gas meter of spreading stain

across the counterpane Around Bar Xanadu
narrow streets fill with the violet steam
of after-midnight the pigeons’ soft venereal
cooing that speak of want like this that deep
original loneliness There are heartless places
in every city you’ve lived Cognac spreads

its window of warmth and the drifting years return
bordered with the crimes of night with cramped
rooms you’ve climbed to dead as the money
in your pockets A “dimestore Mata Hari”
the bureau chief called you while he snipped
a fresh cigar On parched plains outside the city

soldier boys drill before the fighter planes glamorous
with starlight still floating half-asleep
in some Iowa of vinyl booths and Formica miles
of hissing corn But it’s closing hour and beneath
your fingers the napkin snows its raddled lace
across the bar and you must rise with them rise

to dust with the barman his green bottle help him
to don the sparkling jacket Rise to strap
the magic shoes to Irita’s feet
and then you must walk with her these streets
you’ll never leave gritty with wind from Andalusia
riffling your skirt in the scent of blood oranges and sweat"
AnonymousBarbara Allen"In Scarlet town where I was born
There was a fair maid dwellin’
Made every youth cry Well-a-way
Her name was Barbara Allen

All in the merry month of May
When green buds they were swellin’
Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen

He sent his man in to her then
To the town where she was dwellin’
“O haste and come to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen”

So slowly slowly rase she up
And slowly she came nigh him
And when she drew the curtain by—
“Young man I think you’re dyin’”

“O it’s I am sick and very very sick
And it’s all for Barbara Allen”—
O the better for me ye’se never be
Tho’ your heart’s blood were a-spillin’

“O dinna ye mind young man” says she
“When the red wine ye were fillin’
That ye made the healths go round and round
And slighted Barbara Allen”

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was with him dealin’
“Adieu adieu my dear friends all
And be kind to Barbara Allen”

As she was walking o’er the fields
She heard the dead-bell knellin’
And every jow the dead-bell gave
Cried “Woe to Barbara Allen”

“O mother mother make my bed
O make it saft and narrow
